0:00.000	0:00:05.040.040	i'm asking if you can hire employees that was my question yes okay so i'm gonna if any of you dicks
0:00:05.040.040	0:00.000	say i'm not answering this question directly i'm going myself on stream in a video game okay
0:00.000	0:00:17.760.760	can you hire employees in my ideal system yes the answer is no you would have to go to the
0:00:17.760.760	0:00:23.200.199	capital owners which are the public in this case and get them to capitalize your business
0:00:23.200.199	0:00:28.880.879	and you'd have to have a shared ownership structure welcome to the show uh we have
0:00:28.880.879	0:00:35.840.840	an audible connection now um so let's just get this on the road and we'll get to it so welcome
0:00:35.840.840	0:00:42.080.079	welcome welcome yet another episode of wick tv it's across ideological space where we come together to
0:00:42.080.079	0:00:48.240.240	talk about issues both political and cultural from the serious um economy asked me to set this up uh
0:00:49.040.039	0:00.000	because he felt that it would be a more um productive discussion to have kind of like
0:00.000	0:01:01.360.359	correction wick correction already moderator interference the people asked for this to be
0:01:01.360.359	0:01:10.880.879	set up the people people okay uh so the circle strikes already okay well uh voice of the people
0:01:10.880.879	0:01:17.440.439	econoboy why don't we do this we're just debating on capitalism and socialism today and uh the first
0:01:17.440.439	0:01:23.680.680	question i have for econoboy and we're gonna give the mic to him is when you say you're a socialist
0:01:24.400.400	0:01:29.680.680	what do you mean go ahead yeah i thought i thought we were doing opening statements um this is your
0:01:29.680.680	0:01:35.760.760	opening statement go ahead okay okay um well um yeah so i think there's a lot of misunderstandings
0:01:35.760.760	0:01:40.640.640	about my position so i figured doing this discussion directly would um i don't know help clear some of
0:01:40.640.640	0:01:46.160.159	that up at the very least i know a lot of people don't listen okay so hopefully they will today um to
0:01:46.160.159	0:01:52.080.079	answer that question right off the bat uh socialism is when you collectively own the means of production
0:01:52.080.079	0:01:56.400.400	and by the means of production that's basically businesses i think that's what socialism is
0:01:56.400.400	0:02:00.720.719	that's the broadest kind of tent of socialism that i think is the biggest through line
0:02:01.200.200	0:02:05.680.680	of socialist thinkers um and i guess to go on with my opening statement even though it was
0:02:05.680.680	0:02:13.040.039	phrased as a question um why is this preferable to capitalism so um i fundamentally now describe
0:02:13.040.039	0:02:18.880.879	myself as a socialist because i came to a developed egalitarian view where egalitarianism is
0:02:18.880.879	0:02:23.040.039	something that i think is intrinsically valuable for a number of reasons we can relate to each
0:02:23.040.039	0:02:27.760.759	other as equals i think that's a good thing morally speaking i think that the distributional principle
0:02:27.760.759	0:02:32.800.800	of essentially equal access to advantage where advantage is welfare and resources established by
0:02:32.800.800	0:02:38.320.319	g.a cohen i think those are sensible egalitarian views as well and capitalism kind of violates this in
0:02:38.320.319	0:02.000	a number of ways um they it violates it because of the private ownership of the means of production
0:02.000	0:02:48.880.879	sort of unequally distributing wealth uh in society right and unequally distributed wealth means
0:02:48.880.879	0:02:53.920.919	unequally distributed capital income but it also means unequally distributed power in society right
0:02:53.920.919	0:02:58.560.560	wealthy people have a lot more power they have a lot more uh as ryan mulally would say capacity but
0:02:58.560.560	0:03:03.600.599	i would just say freedom um and i think that that's probably not good especially on balance of your
0:03:03.600.599	0:03:07.680.680	other values essentially if we can create a more equal society without destroying the economy or
0:03:07.680.680	0:03:11.200.199	you know destroying innovation or something like that then i think that we should do it
0:03:11.200.199	0:03:15.760.759	um and then i maybe you'd sacrifice some level of like utility or something for some like
0:03:15.760.759	0:03:21.040.039	radical increase in equality um perhaps um and so i think that that's just something that
0:03:21.600.599	0:03:27.440.439	is important i think that inequality itself needs a reason to exist and our current unequal society just
0:03:27.440.439	0:03:33.200.199	doesn't have a good enough reason if you ask me now uh to go on to finish out i'll talk about my
0:03:33.200.199	0:03:38.160.159	model very briefly i think that the capital allocation profit motive like these kind of competitive
0:03:38.160.159	0:03:43.200.199	processes are important the way that capitalism kind of works today is that we have huge asset
0:03:43.200.199	0:03:49.200.199	managers that allocate a huge proportion of the capital in society and so basically what i'm saying
0:03:49.200.199	0:03:54.320.319	is we should transition that process that capital management asset process from private hands to
0:03:54.320.319	0:03:58.960.960	public hands in the form of sovereign wealth funds and holding corporations to where we can eat
0:03:58.960.960	0:04:03.760.759	up a large chunk of the economy if not the whole economy if things just end up working out really really well
0:04:03.760.759	0:04:10.720.719	by doing this um one small caveat before i you know give it over to wick and destiny is when i reference
0:04:10.720.719	0:04:15.520.520	countries i've heard people say that i said this i've never said this and i won't say it today
0:04:16.320.319	0:04:22.320.319	i don't think that the nordic countries are socialist countries okay i think that socialism is when you
0:04:22.320.319	0:04:27.040.040	collectively own the means of production societies exist on a spectrum between total private ownership
0:04:27.040.040	0:04:31.920.920	and total collective ownership the socialist ideal the capitalist ideal the nordic economies the reason
0:04:31.920.920	0:04:37.280.279	i reference them is because they've engaged in a process of socializing at least a very large chunk
0:04:37.280.279	0:04:41.440.439	of their economies and we can see kind of the fruits of that where they have reasonably decent
0:04:41.440.439	0:04:47.120.120	levels of economic growth employment good unionization things like that high equality and i think that
0:04:47.120.120	0:04:53.200.199	those are just good examples of the process where i want to move society towards okay well thanks for
0:04:53.200.199	0:05:00.480.480	being here uh destiny why is capitalism the superior system to whatever econoboy just said um because
0:05:00.480.480	0:05:04.560.560	capitalism is based i just want to start off by saying that i spent a lot of time on amazon because
0:05:04.560.560	0:05:13.840.839	i was going to respond to econoboy's horrible appropriation of violent communist flags and other
0:05:13.840.839	0:05:17.680.680	stuff in the background i was going to buy a bunch of nazi and they don't actually sell nazi flags on amazon
0:05:17.680.680	0:05:22.560.560	so i don't appreciate that i feel like it's very uh one-sided and and how they run things over there
0:05:23.280.279	0:05:30.880.879	um the when it comes to like a larger discussion on this um i don't know if i need to clarify this
0:05:30.880.879	0:05:34.160.160	or not but i guess just for anybody listening who doesn't catch everything on every platform
0:05:34.160.160	0:05:39.600.600	obviously there were a lot of heated debates between me and pisco and econoboy and other members
0:05:39.600.600	0:05:44.480.480	of different communities having to do with like leftists and tankies and bad actors and everything
0:05:44.480.480	0:05:49.200.199	uh just to clarify for the 50 millionth time i don't think econoboy is a secret tanky i don't think
0:05:49.200.199	0:05:53.440.439	he's secretly trying to be subversive or doing things i do disagree i think fundamentally with
0:05:53.440.439	0:05:57.440.439	a lot of his platform but not in the same way that i would say that like um other like marxist
0:05:57.440.439	0:06:02.240.240	latinists are bad faith actors trying to worm the weight of the system to destroy everything in a way
0:06:02.240.240	0:06:06.800.800	that they're not upfront about i guess for anybody that needs to hear that or isn't uh clear of that
0:06:07.440.439	0:06:11.920.920	um so i guess our conversation will probably revolve around a few things in this uh debate or
0:06:11.920.920	0:06:15.920.920	conversation whatever we call this so i think the first issue i have is i think there's like an unclear
0:06:15.920.920	0:06:22.480.480	vision of what socialism actually is or means uh i think it's kind of ironic or not ironic but funny
0:06:22.480.480	0:06:27.040.040	i guess that econoboy kind of started off clarifying you know what his version of socialism is that he
0:06:27.040.040	0:06:32.320.319	doesn't think that nordic countries are socialist and i just it seems like that on one hand you want
0:06:32.320.319	0:06:35.760.759	to say not not econoboy in general but on one hand like people want to say that they're socialists
0:06:35.760.759	0:06:39.920.920	but then you fight so much against like what socialism means or what it doesn't mean that the label starts
0:06:39.920.920	0:06:44.240.240	to become meaningless and i think that the issue is that it allows for a lot of bad faith actors to come in and
0:06:44.240.240	0:06:49.760.759	kind of usurp that label and use it as kind of a disguise or a mask for more insidious views so i
0:06:49.760.759	0:06:53.200.199	think it's one reason i don't like the socialist label if what somebody's advocating for is largely
0:06:53.200.199	0:06:58.080.079	liberal or works in a liberal or capitalist framework um i think there are huge moral and democratic
0:06:58.080.079	0:07:03.360.360	questions about what the expropriation of property ultimately looks like a lot of the examples i think
0:07:03.360.360	0:07:08.720.720	that econoboy gives for how we could expropriate property i think are a little bit uh unsatisfactory so
0:07:08.720.720	0:07:13.680.680	when we bring up things like civil assets for civil asset forfeiture or things like a eminent domain
0:07:13.680.680	0:07:18.240.240	like we're not taking these things to socialize them or to make them like a part of a socialist
0:07:18.240.240	0:07:22.160.160	economy usually they're done for other reasons sometimes for punishments for crimes or sometimes
0:07:22.160.160	0:07:27.040.040	for you know necessary government projects i don't think that those comparisons are the same as trying
0:07:27.040.040	0:07:32.720.720	to acquire 90 to 100 percent of the overall capital of the united states uh you know under the ownership
0:07:32.720.720	0:07:39.200.199	of the government i think that um when we talk about egalitarianism and when we talk about idealized
0:07:39.200.199	0:07:43.840.839	forms of economies uh i don't know how much time i'll argue this but i think it's interesting that
0:07:43.840.839	0:07:49.440.439	you always hear this argument even capitalists give here arguments will uh uh socialists will say and
0:07:49.440.439	0:07:53.680.680	capitalists will say well you know socialism only works in an idealized form of society where there's
0:07:53.680.680	0:07:57.840.839	no human greed and in an ideal world maybe we'd be socialist but i don't actually know why that's
0:07:57.840.839	0:08:01.760.759	true i feel like people assume that and it's not necessarily the case like i can envision an ideal
0:08:01.760.759	0:08:06.800.800	socialist world where everybody shares in the means of production and we all get the fruits of our own
0:08:06.800.800	0:08:11.040.040	labor and you know we all can do that sure but i could also conceive of an ideal capitalist world
0:08:11.040.040	0:08:14.720.720	where everybody has really high paying jobs they can choose who they want to work for at any point
0:08:14.720.720	0:08:18.640.639	in time and quit and leave and like i feel like you could have idealized versions of both worlds
0:08:18.640.639	0:08:22.400.399	it's just difficult because with capitalism there's a real world implementation of that and you have to
0:08:22.400.399	0:08:26.240.240	fight on that real world implementation and then on the socialist version you have to fight on the
0:08:26.240.240	0:08:32.480.480	kind of like idealized or utopian version so it's harder to kind of like point out flaws um four and
0:08:32.480.480	0:08:36.800.799	five i think uh for the fourth point i've got socializing profits is a thing that socialists
0:08:36.800.799	0:08:39.920.919	always talk about like we want equal ownership in the means of production so that we can all kind
0:08:39.920.919	0:08:44.400.399	of reap the rewards and i think that's an attractive quality about sharing the ownership of the means
0:08:44.400.399	0:08:48.960.960	production but it also means socializing decisions and i feel like there's not as much time paid to
0:08:48.960.960	0:08:53.840.840	the socializing decisions parts so for instance if the government owns 90 to 100 percent of all the
0:08:53.840.840	0:08:57.840.840	capital in the country that means that every new business started kind of has to be started by the
0:08:57.840.840	0:09:02.240.240	government so are we taking votes on that are they going to be picking winners and losers are they
0:09:02.240.240	0:09:08.080.080	going to decide you know whether or not there's an 18 or older id verification limit on my gravity
0:09:08.080.080	0:09:13.600.600	consumption or whether or not league of legends gets canceled for dota 2 or whatever else um and then
0:09:13.600.600	0:09:18.720.720	i think that for the final thing um this is kind of a general complaint i've had when people talk
0:09:18.720.720	0:09:22.640.639	about like oh you know we got these really good things because of socialism in the united states
0:09:22.640.639	0:09:26.480.480	whether you're talking minimum wage or 40-hour work weeks or whatever else i think it's important to
0:09:26.480.480	0:09:30.800.799	clarify that all of these things are happening in a liberal system and there are good things that
0:09:30.800.799	0:09:35.440.440	can happen from lots of different modes of economic production and lots of different countries that
0:09:35.440.440	0:09:39.920.919	can happen in a liberal capitalist system but if we were to move to a fully socialist system we could
0:09:39.920.919	0:09:43.520.519	only do the good socialist things you wouldn't have any of the good capitalist things and i think that
0:09:43.520.519	0:09:54.240.240	is problematic uh is that your goal economy to uh move to a entirely socialist system yeah i mean i think
0:09:54.240.240	0:10:00.320.320	that again i think that there's moral reasons to think that the socialist ideal of complete social
0:10:00.320.320	0:10:05.760.759	ownership of businesses would be a good thing right that you know again if we could and this is
0:10:05.760.759	0:10:10.080.080	something that i've said before i think a kind of a typical argument that people will make against
0:10:10.080.080	0:10:15.920.919	socialism is oh well you know it looks great on paper which is to say like you know intuitively
0:10:15.920.919	0:10:20.720.720	sure like a totally egalitarian system looks great but it just doesn't work right we just we just
0:10:20.720.720	0:10:25.440.440	can't make it work for one reason or another um and i would say that look i mean i i guess i don't
0:10:25.440.440	0:10:31.360.360	know as we move through the process of like fully socializing the economy um exactly what it would look
0:10:31.360.360	0:10:36.800.799	like when we start to get to 80 85 90 percent of businesses being collectively owned but i think that
0:10:36.800.799	0:10:42.080.080	there's strong reason to believe that we can at least get a great majority of the way there uh without
0:10:42.080.080	0:10:46.960.960	these kind of huge deleterious effects effects on the economy and at the end of the day i'm not super
0:10:46.960.960	0:10:52.320.320	stubborn about this like if we get to whatever 75 like we've replaced institutional private investors
0:10:52.320.320	0:10:57.200.200	with institutional public investors which is to say about 75 of the stock market and all this kind
0:10:57.200.200	0:11:01.600.600	of stuff is owned publicly instead of privately um and all of a sudden you know we have this kind
0:11:01.600.600	0:11:06.720.720	of like radically egalitarian system compared to what we had before with similar standards of living
0:11:06.720.720	0:11:11.760.759	i guess i'm just not so offended by that right but in our current system where we have just such a
0:11:11.760.759	0:11:16.400.399	high level of inequality wealth inequality income inequality um and what i think to be pretty
0:11:16.400.399	0:11.000	obvious solutions towards um fixing that problem uh in pretty direct ways and we can look at other
0:11.000	0:11.000	examples of countries that have done that um we should certainly do it because i think that most
0:11.000	0:11:31.680.679	people have at the very least egalitarian instincts and so we should move toward that direction um even
0:11:31.680.679	0:11:36.560.559	if once we get there it's like oh you know we have to kind of make some some sticky decisions on the
0:11:36.560.559	0:11:41.680.679	edge um i think that the bigger discussion is should we move towards that direction and what is moving
0:11:41.680.679	0:11:45.520.519	towards that direction look like uh because certainly i think that we should and certainly i think that
0:11:45.520.519	0:11:51.280.279	there's a good way to move towards that direction can i okay can i ask a question on this i'm trying
0:11:51.280.279	0:11:58.560.559	to hone in when you say moral reasons okay so my understanding is if you had a fully socialist society
0:11:58.560.559	0:12:03.440.440	where all of the workers are owning all other means of productions that that would basically do little
0:12:03.440.440	0:12:09.200.200	if anything to address overall wealth inequality no wouldn't you still have massive wealth inequality
0:12:09.200.200	0:12:15.120.120	um across different firms even if not within different firms so for instance if there was like a
0:12:15.120.120	0:12:19.760.759	cooperatively owned or socialist owned engineering firm wouldn't all those people make way more money
0:12:19.760.759	0:12:26.720.720	than the cooperatively owned janitorial cleaning services firm yeah yeah so i think it's important
0:12:26.720.720	0:12:32.640.639	to maybe take a step back so there's a lot of different ways to collectively own the means of
0:12:32.640.639	0:12:37.760.759	production worker ownership is just one of those ways um now i'm i don't really uh favor a worker
0:12:37.760.759	0:12:42.960.960	ownership model personally i tend to favor social ownership models through things like expansion of
0:12:42.960.960	0:12:46.880.879	government services which i probably you and i would agree that some government services should be
0:12:46.880.879	0:12:51.600.600	expanded like public transit health care systems things like that um and then i think that the the
0:12:51.600.600	0:12:56.720.720	bulk of the market economy should be uh owned by these kind of publicly owned holding corporations
0:12:56.720.720	0:13:01.360.360	and sovereign wealth funds which compete against each other similar to how current asset managers
0:13:01.360.360	0:13:08.880.879	already do and that would create a hugely egalitarian distribution because public wealth is sort of
0:13:08.880.879	0:13:14.240.240	necessarily horizontally distributed because the way that that wealth is managed is one person one vote
0:13:14.240.240	0:13:20.160.159	um not necessarily one worker and one cooperative one vote i hope that makes sense okay so then if
0:13:20.160.159	0:13:26.560.559	so we're saying that the businesses are collectively owned meaning that so employees could still like
0:13:26.560.559	0:13:32.240.240	quit and go to other jobs or get education and training go to other jobs um does this mean that the
0:13:32.240.240	0:13:39.360.360	government then would be basically collecting the excess and worker um like in the value produced by the
0:13:39.360.360	0:13:44.720.720	worker the government would basically be the stand-in for the capital owner there well i mean even marks
0:13:44.720.720	0:13:50.560.559	in his critique of the gotha program said that you the worker is not entitled to the entire surplus
0:13:50.560.559	0:13:56.320.320	value that they create that you need money to be set aside for things like administration welfare
0:13:56.320.320	0:14:01.040.039	payments um and i think he also said like essentially capital rotation like reinvestments in capital
0:14:01.040.039	0:14:05.920.919	right and so similarly right by having a social ownership model we're essentially accomplishing
0:14:05.920.919	0:14:10.960.960	all those goals at once where the worker has returned a substantial portion of the value that
0:14:10.960.960	0:14:16.560.559	they create because obviously workers still enjoy the fruits of the government's services and welfare
0:14:16.560.559	0:14:21.360.360	payments and you know ubi or whatever we use the capital income for um but it also goes to those
0:14:21.360.360	0:14:25.840.840	other things that marks identified as important as well you know just general welfare payments for
0:14:25.840.840	0:14:30.720.720	people who can't work he i think he identified the elderly and people like that as well um and of
0:14:30.720.720	0:14:34.320.320	course the government can also make public investments with that money as well okay so i'm
0:14:34.320.320	0:14.000	trying to just understand so like administration fees i wouldn't consider this like um capital
0:14.000	0:14:44.960.960	owner right so when i think of capital i think of for a business you are deploying um you're you're
0:14:44.960.960	0:14:48.080.080	you're deploying your capital and then you're deploying your labor and then when the labor interacts
0:14:48.080.080	0:14:53.760.759	with the capital the labor is creating some value and then when that product is like sold to some
0:14:53.760.759	0:14:58.640.639	consumer um some money goes back to the cost of the business but there's an excess at the top after
0:14:58.640.639	0:15:03.520.519	administrative fees after everything else and that excess at the top would go to the capital investor
0:15:03.520.519	0:15:07.600.600	and i'm just trying to understand so in this state you would have the capital investor the capital
0:15:07.600.600	0:15:14.320.320	owner the owner class is just replaced by the state right yeah the capital owners would be the public at
0:15:14.320.320	0:15:19.680.679	large right so again i think that um marx obviously a lot of in marx's writings he's a little bit vague
0:15:19.680.679	0:15:25.440.440	obviously he recommended at some points in his life he recommended state ownership um but it seemed like
0:15:25.440.440	0:15:29.360.360	there was a cooperative ownership model maybe in the mature part of his life um at the end of the
0:15:29.360.360	0:15.000	day though i'm just saying that number one i don't think that marx is like a definitive view of what
0:15.000	0:15:38.960.960	socialism is but even to the extent that he is i think that the spirit of this where the worker receives
0:15:38.960.960	0:15:45.440.440	a great you know a great portion of the value that they create but set aside for the rest of society
0:15:45.440.440	0:15:50.800.799	things like administrative expenses capital investment and welfare payments i think that the spirit of
0:15:50.800.799	0:15:56.480.480	that is accomplished with a social ownership model as well and of course um to the extent that maybe
0:15:56.480.480	0:16:00.160.159	some marx historian would just say no kind of what you're totally wrong and misinterpreting marx it's
0:16:00.160.159	0:16:05.440.440	like whatever you know my system's much more egalitarian so that's why i prefer it sure so i'm
0:16:05.440.440	0:16:09.040.039	not i'm not trying to figure out what marks i'm just trying for your personal um just so that we can
0:16:09.040.039	0:16:15.440.440	understand i guess what i guess you would advocate for personally so when so then we're saying that the
0:16.000	0:16:19.200.200	okay so just come back so i understand well i don't know if mark series or discursion okay you're just
0:16:19.200.200	0:16:23.760.759	you're replacing the capital owner of a business with the state essentially with a government right
0:16:24.960.960	0:16:29.360.360	yeah ultimately the state would be the owner of the shares in some complex system but it's managed
0:16:29.360.360	0:16:38.720.720	through these kind of holding corporations and sovereign wealth funds um okay so the um so the
0:16:38.720.720	0:16:45.360.360	state has ownership and then the the management um does the state like you don't have to be like
0:16:45.360.360	0:16:49.920.919	hyper specific but i'm trying to understand what the managing structure i guess would look like so
0:16:49.920.919	0:16:55.840.840	it's not the state making the decisions it's the holding companies or yeah so i think that these
0:16:55.840.840	0:17:00.480.480	things should be kind of technocratically managed um you know you mentioned that people should really
0:17:00.480.480	0:17:05.440.440	focus on that kind of decision making process and that was a large part of what the third part of
0:17:05.440.440	0:17:10.640.640	my substack was about it was like how do these capital allocation decisions get made um as inspired by
0:17:10.640.640	0:17:14.880.880	this book that i read the public wealth of nations and so essentially what i would recommend is that
0:17:14.880.880	0:17:19.200.200	the way that the public should manage its wealth is it should be in these competing holding
0:17:19.200.200	0:17:24.320.319	corporations which are capitalized initially by the state in one way or another you know however the
0:17:24.320.319	0:17:28.800.799	state gets its money to capitalize the funds these funds would then be managed by professional
0:17:28.800.799	0:17:33.040.039	investment managers kind of at arm's length from the state you can think of it sort of like the
0:17:33.040.039	0:17:37.520.519	federal reserve right where the federal reserve is kind of this like quasi-independent private
0:17:37.520.519	0:17:42.240.240	agency type situation but it's more technocratically managed do that same kind of similar
0:17:42.240.240	0:17:45.760.759	structure but with all these different competing holding corporations that operate independently
0:17:45.760.759	0:17:50.640.640	from each other but are ultimately owned by the state and then as they allocate that capital and
0:17:50.640.640	0:17:55.120.119	the returns from that capital kind of trickle up to them they would dividend out part of that to the state
0:17:55.120.119	0:17:59.120.119	directly and then they would use part of that to reinvest in other businesses and other entrepreneurial
0:17:59.120.119	0:18:06.560.559	activity similar to how private asset managers do today the um how are they initially capitalized by the
0:18:06.560.559	0:18:13.440.440	state like how would a state decide like oh like there's you know five firms that do stuff i guess
0:18:13.440.440	0:18:19.440.440	yeah how does that i recommend a path um in the same stuff stack that i referenced um so there's there's
0:18:19.440.440	0:18:26.320.319	there's three main ways so number one is the state already owns unbeknownst to it a lot of public wealth
0:18:26.320.319	0:18:30.640.640	um dag debtor in the public wealth of nations book he estimates that basically because the state just has
0:18:30.640.640	0:18:37.280.279	really poor system of accounting the state already owns about one times gdp worth of public assets
0:18:37.280.279	0:18:41.760.759	they just don't account for them properly and so what a lot of states have done um both in relation
0:18:41.760.759	0:18:46.560.559	to dag debtor's work but then you know an opposite to that is they've just accounted for their current
0:18:46.560.559	0:18:52.240.240	public assets and spun them off into these holding corporations to be managed entrepreneurially the state
0:18:52.240.240	0:18:55.840.839	just realizes oh we own a lot of real estate oh we have all these soes that we don't really account
0:18:55.840.839	0:19:00.480.480	for properly we have all these kind of like state kind of quasi state service companies that we run
0:19:00.800.799	0:19:05.520.519	let's put those into a commercial bucket holding corporation professional investment managers
0:19:05.520.519	0:19:09.680.680	allocate that capital run it professionally so that's one way wait on the first thing having
0:19:09.680.680	0:19:13.520.519	having wealth so wealth broadly speaking can include things like capital you can't invest
0:19:13.520.519	0:19:17.520.519	like a like a like capital we're not if we're not talking money like just because you might have
0:19:17.520.519	0:19:21.680.680	like a ownership a state ownership of a bunch of utility companies or power plants i mean you can just
0:19:21.680.680	0:19:26.320.319	invest that because it's your that's represented by like physical capital not like just money right
0:19:26.320.319	0:19:30.560.559	yeah yeah it's it's a mixture of things right so it's it's physical capital the the the public
0:19:30.560.559	0:19:36.560.559	at large the the most poorly accounted for assets in a public portfolio are typically real estate assets
0:19:36.560.559	0:19:42.240.240	you know municipal buildings rights of way public lands you know things like that um and so what
0:19:42.240.240	0:19:46.240.240	you would do is you'd you'd put all that capital into a single portfolio you know this would be worth
0:19:46.240.240	0:19:50.400.400	about 29 trillion dollars some of those assets like you said wouldn't be commercial they'd be like
0:19:50.400.400	0:19:54.720.720	state parks or you know municipal buildings that are currently in use it's like well we're not gonna
0:19:54.720.720	0:19:59.520.519	like use these for a for-profit purpose but for all those assets that we now discover and that we
0:19:59.520.519	0:20:08.460.460	would want to put oh hello is this me or him 15 or 14 and a half trillion dollars then you could take
0:20:08.460.460	0:20:13.100.099	all of that oh wick is everything okay you're good oh yeah you just you froze for a minute and we were
0:20:13.100.099	0:20:18.700.700	okay did i lose um yeah you you can take all of those real estate assets and then say okay well
0:20:18.700.700	0:20:22.700.700	let's just start developing them right and so part of that could be real estate development it could be
0:20:22.700.700	0:20:26.860.859	selling that off and investing in equities just kind of generally building the wealth of society
0:20:26.860.859	0:20:30.940.940	that's just one way well wait i'm just trying to understand this for the first thing i'm super
0:20:30.940.940	0:20:34.700.700	confused okay so it sounded like we were saying so i'm trying to figure out like um how do you
0:20:34.700.700	0:20:38.620.619	capitalize um these initial public holding corporations so like where do they get their
0:20:38.620.619	0:20:42.140.140	money from initially and then it sounded like the answer was well there is actually a whole bunch
0:20:42.140.140	0:20:45.980.980	of wealth that exists in the united states is actually not accounted for right now um which i
0:20:45.980.980	0:20:49.340.339	agree is actually a weird problem we talk about gdp but we don't actually know the nation's wealth
0:20:49.340.339	0:20:52.540.539	um like what is the total public accounting of all the assets and then you say well there's a lot of these
0:20:52.540.539	0:20:55.820.819	things that exist out there that aren't accounted for very well and so we can have a better accounting
0:20:55.820.819	0:20:59.500.500	of them it's like okay but when we have that better accounting of them we're not talking about money
0:20:59.500.500	0:21:03.980.980	sitting in bank accounts we're talking about we're like the stuff that capital is allocated to that it
0:21:03.980.980	0:21:07.820.819	buys so like like power plants or real estate or whatever simply answer your question they would
0:21:07.820.819	0:21:12.620.619	be sold for money or they would be developed directly how would they sell it but if we're talking
0:21:12.620.619	0:21:16.220.220	about a model where we're moving to public ownership of all these things who are you selling it to
0:21:17.420.420	0:21:20.700.700	well i mean you you have to transition from one system to another through some
0:21:20.700.700	0:21:24.060.059	deliberative process right so currently they would be sold to like a bunch of different
0:21:24.060.059	0:21:28.300.299	whatever private investors or other like state investors who would want to invest in those
0:21:28.300.299	0:21:32.060.059	like oh we want to buy this real estate we'll exchange it for cash and then the pub the holding
0:21:32.060.059	0:21:37.100.099	corporation can take that cash and then do other development activities invested in public equity is
0:21:37.100.099	0:21:41.660.660	you know just do entrepreneurial investing and you know balance sheet management just like any of
0:21:41.660.660	0:21:46.700.700	these other asset managers do and then they buy through that process they would accumulate capital
0:21:46.700.700	0:21:51.180.180	i just the examples that we're giving here can you give me a couple examples of things
0:21:51.980.980	0:21:55.420.420	that you would that seems like a horrible idea hold on i'm sorry because i'm thinking like the
0:21:55.420.420	0:21:59.580.579	things that the public owns to be thinking like are we selling national parks for cash to capitalize
0:21:59.580.579	0:22:04.300.299	our new public homes are we selling like section housing or are we selling like power plants i just
0:22:05.020.019	0:22:08.540.539	i just said i just said there are going to be some assets that are not commercial in nature i
0:22:08.540.539	0:22:12.940.940	even reference national parks like you probably wouldn't you know use a you wouldn't sell a national
0:22:12.940.940	0:22:20.380.380	park for cash but there's a lot of and or abandoned buildings that the government owns that it doesn't
0:22:20.380.380	0:22:24.940.940	use productively because the government just has a very poor system of accounting for those assets
0:22:24.940.940	0:22:29.660.660	right um and so to the extent that we have assets like that that we think like you know we're not
0:22:29.660.660	0:22:33.500.500	using this basically for any productive purpose we can either lease those out for development
0:22:33.500.500	0:22:36.860.859	directly to strip back cash from the market and use for other entrepreneurial activities
0:22:36.860.859	0:22:41.980.980	or we could which is to say directly develop them or we could just sell those for cash and then use
0:22:41.980.980	0:22:47.180.180	the cash these kind of socialized rents uh for other entrepreneurial activity investing in equities
0:22:47.180.180	0:22:51.180.180	you know private equity invest you know whatever it ends up being and through that process the state
0:22:51.180.180	0:22:56.940.940	now is you know either developing assets directly or it transfers assets for cash and uses the cash for
0:22:56.940.940	0:23:01.260.259	development activities okay i understand the answer i think it's very unsatisfactory but okay i got
0:23:01.260.259	0:23:05.660.660	part one and then you had two more other points yeah right so the other the other two ways that the
0:23:05.660.660	0:23:10.700.700	state could capitalize these funds um number one is just through efficient tax revenue right so you just
0:23:10.700.700	0:23:15.340.339	you know take tax money and you know capitalize funds oh this you know we're gonna we're gonna
0:23:15.340.339	0:23:18.780.779	dedicate a certain amount of tax revenue to a sovereign wealth fund every year and then
0:23:18.780.779	0:23:22.060.059	once the sovereign wealth fund accumulates enough capital we're gonna split it off into these
0:23:22.060.059	0:23:26.780.779	different holding corporations um you know you could certainly do it that way um another way that
0:23:26.780.779	0:23:29.980.980	the last thing that i'll say which i think is kind of a you know an interesting way to think about
0:23:29.980.980	0:23:33.660.660	the bank of japan does something a little bit similar is that the federal reserve engages in
0:23:33.660.660	0:23:39.580.579	quantitative easing where the federal reserve creates money and then transfers the cash that
0:23:39.580.579	0:23:45.020.019	they created with financial assets but our federal reserve has the restriction where they only use
0:23:45.020.019	0:23:50.460.460	that cash to buy fixed income you know they don't buy equities with that and so what we could do is
0:23:50.460.460	0:23:55.340.339	engage in the same counter cyclical policy that we already engage in and instead of just buying
0:23:55.340.339	0:24:00.220.220	debt instruments we could buy equities as well and through that process we could accumulate capital
0:24:00.220.220	0:24:04.380.380	and then transfer that capital into a sovereign wealth fund and then eventually split it off into
0:24:04.380.380	0:24:09.900.900	competing holding corporations once the sovereign wealth fund gets big enough um okay and then that
0:24:09.900.900	0:24:14.940.940	way so okay so so i understand the i guess we so we have a couple of ways that we would get the money
0:24:14.940.940	0:24:18.860.859	there how do you make the decision of like how many of these holding companies will you have
0:24:19.420.420	0:24:26.300.299	and and who gets like how do you do that part yeah i think uh in terms of the decision making on
0:24:26.300.299	0:24:30.620.619	how you would do it i i think you would want to have as rules based a system as possible
0:24:30.620.619	0:24:34.620.619	um you know currently i don't know that i would have any strict upper limits on like how big a
0:24:34.620.619	0:24:39.420.420	holding corporation could be um i think that once you would say like oh the sovereign wealth fund
0:24:39.420.420	0:24:44.540.539	accumulated 15 trillion dollars and we're going to spit it off spin it off into like 15 different
0:24:44.540.539	0:24:48.780.779	one trillion dollar holding corporations as like an initial portfolio you could do something like
0:24:48.780.779	0:24:53.500.500	that but i think that it's important to note that like currently asset allocation is highly
0:24:53.500.500	0:24:58.060.059	concentrated i mean i think the top two asset managers in the country control something like
0:24:58.060.059	0:25:02.780.779	15 or 20 trillion dollars worth of wealth just in and of themselves um and so the holding
0:25:02.780.779	0:25:05.900.900	corporations that do the best are going to accumulate the most capital and make the most
0:25:05.900.900	0:25:09.820.819	returns yeah i would i would i would i these are assets under management they're not assets
0:25:09.820.819	0:25:13.180.180	controlled directly by the holding companies number one which i think is significantly different
0:25:13.180.180	0:25:16.540.539	because individuals still have the ability to allocate their portfolios portfolios the way that
0:25:16.540.539	0:25:22.700.700	they see fit and then two um these people the the assets under management these these large firms
0:25:22.700.700	0:25:28.220.220	are not owning the things like wholesale that they are managing assets for right like it's not like
0:25:28.220.220	0:25:33.260.259	blackrock um or any of these huge assets under management firms are like making decisions for
0:25:33.260.259	0:25:37.420.420	all of these companies unilaterally kind of like our public holding corporations would be so i feel
0:25:37.420.420	0:25:42.460.460	like these are meaningfully different well in those two ways yeah it's not meaningfully different um
0:25:42.460.460	0:25:46.700.700	you know what i advocate for is a couple of different structures so on on the first point of
0:25:46.700.700	0:25:50.940.940	well wait wait wait just in terms of the meaningfully different it's different to say that somebody
0:25:50.940.940	0:25:54.540.539	has 10 ownership of a stock in a company versus somebody has like a controlling share that's
0:25:54.540.539	0:25:59.340.339	making all the decisions for the company right right but i don't i don't necessarily advocate
0:25:59.340.339	0:26:03.340.339	for holding corporations always buying controlling interest in companies right that's what i was
0:26:03.340.339	0:26:08.540.539	going to explain so okay um these yeah so these holding corporations again i my goal is that these
0:26:08.540.539	0:26:13.420.420	holding corporations would have similar mandates to current asset managers which is to say that they
0:26:13.420.420	0:26:19.340.339	would have you know some basic kind of return threshold they would need to actively manage the funds and that
0:26:19.340.339	0:26:23.740.740	once they um distribute those funds they need to balance it on a risk-adjusted basis they need
0:26:23.740.740	0:26:28.540.539	to have like a you know essentially a a risk-weighted portfolio which doesn't which means that
0:26:28.540.539	0:26:32.380.380	typically speaking you wouldn't just go out and buy like a majority of amazon stock you know you might
0:26:32.380.380	0:26:36.940.940	buy two percent of amazon stock and one percent of apple and one percent of walmart you know you'd have
0:26:36.940.940	0:26:42.220.220	a a distributed highly distributed portfolio of assets and maybe you do a little bit of private equity
0:26:42.220.220	0:26:46.460.460	investing or venture capital on the side um well yeah i feel like the first point that you made well
0:26:46.460.460	0:26:52.380.380	i just want to be careful because like one extra point yeah sure go ahead sure um okay so that we
0:26:52.380.380	0:26:58.540.539	stay kind of in one area because there are things that i think would be super based like having some kind
0:26:58.540.539	0:27:05.100.099	of public basically a public dividend for large companies in the united states um that is returned to
0:27:05.100.099	0:27:09.020.019	like every american citizen i think is an amazing idea because it gives all of us a feeling of
0:27:09.020.019	0:27:13.820.819	accomplishment and investment and like return when our companies do well like if facebook or amazon or
0:27:13.820.819	0:27:16.700.700	somebody posts huge earnings the average american doesn't give a unless you have stock in it right
0:27:16.700.700	0:27:22.620.619	and i think having some ownership there is great um but we're we're not talking about just these
0:27:22.620.619	0:27:26.940.940	funds that are broadly diversified and invested in the economy because this just sounds like kind of
0:27:26.940.940	0:27:33.340.339	um an extravagant like ira or 401k basically and i think that's meaningfully different than we were
0:27:33.340.339	0:27:38.860.859	i think we were kind of talking about like controlling shares for these companies no well it's
0:27:39.180.180	0:27:44.060.059	so okay so the controlling shares would be that the public would own the holding corporation
0:27:44.060.059	0:27:47.980.980	right but we're talking about the holding corporations which would independently manage
0:27:47.980.980	0:27:52.060.059	the accumulated wealth of the public so it's a matter of like what are the holding corporations
0:27:52.060.059	0:27:56.140.140	actually own and so let's just imagine we get to like my ideal end state you know we've got like
0:27:56.140.140	0:28:00.380.380	a hundred different of these holding corporations right um and they've kind of like eaten up you know
0:28:00.380.380	0:28:04.780.779	blackrock is literally like a publicly owned company at this point right sure kind of all of those other
0:28:04.780.779	0:28:09.180.180	well blackrock is not even close to probably right but hold on when we say blackrock is publicly owned
0:28:09.180.180	0:28:14.140.140	but it's a you know it's a publicly traded company i'm just using that as a as a oh you were saying
0:28:14.140.140	0:28:17.980.980	if they were probably i understand yeah okay if we say holding corporations what i'm trying to figure out
0:28:17.980.980	0:28:22.940.940	is like how did these get created like let's say that there are let's say that there are two holding
0:28:22.940.940	0:28:27.740.740	corporations in my state and one is called like um like green energy forever and the other one is
0:28:27.740.740	0:28:32.540.539	called like you know veganism rules and i really want to invest in companies i would prefer my money
0:28:32.540.539	0:28:37.660.660	would go to the the coal-fired dog-eating factory people or whatever right how does like a new holding
0:28:37.660.660	0:28:41.820.819	corporation get created they would allocate money in a way that i would want to see my public money go
0:28:41.820.819	0:28:44.780.779	towards that's what i'm trying to figure like how do you create those new holding corporations you've
0:28:44.780.779	0:28:47.820.819	talked about how you would capitalize them yeah okay so who would decide how to make them yeah
0:28:49.100.099	0:28:53.020.019	well i mean the well in terms of who would decide how to make them i mean that like i said i mean
0:28:53.020.019	0:28:57.180.180	i think that would be a rules-based process you'd probably have some kind of super structure for
0:28:57.180.180	0:29:01.100.099	you know some basic rules that you would establish for managing the whole portfolio of holding
0:29:01.100.099	0:29:05.660.660	corporations where they would decide you know okay like what are the basic guidances we want to give to
0:29:05.660.660	0:29:09.820.819	these holding corporations um what are the kind of like transparency requirements that we would have
0:29:09.820.819	0:29:15.740.740	and then similar to your point like okay well this is how we would uh determine when to spin off new
0:29:15.740.740	0:29:20.860.859	holding corporations with the accumulations from either tax revenue other public assets or the sovereign
0:29:20.860.859	0:29:25.660.660	wealth fund right so okay okay the only the only reason i'm focusing on this this part so hard is
0:29:25.660.660	0:29:29.900.900	because in my opinion one of the best advantages of capitalism if you want to be a capitalist cuck which
0:29:29.900.900	0:29:36.940.940	i am um is that capital can respond efficiently and quickly and robustly to huge economic problems i
0:29:36.940.940	0:29:40.540.539	think when people argue there was some paper i think it was on uh working favorite iber or whatever
0:29:40.540.539	0:29:44.220.220	that said like no liberal economy in the history of the planet has had a massive famine or whatever
0:29:44.220.220	0:29:47.420.420	and part and i think part of the argument was that not only is the media able to report on
0:29:47.420.420	0:29:51.100.099	things quickly but capital can shift very quickly around to different sections of the economy to respond
0:29:51.100.099	0:29:55.420.420	and adapt to different things so this is so one of the advantages of capital is that people can
0:29:55.420.420	0:29:58.780.779	identify market signals put money in an area and invest in something and then you know do do whatever
0:29:58.780.779	0:30:03.740.740	they want there but when we talk about these holding corporations we're talking about removing that
0:30:03.740.740	0:30:08.380.380	decision-making apparatus and and and somehow making it a government thing and i'm trying to figure
0:30:08.380.380	0:30:12.380.380	out like how are these things made and if to gloss over this and then to move on to the rest of
0:30:12.380.380	0:30:16.700.700	stuff this is like the hard stuff that i would argue that if capital does anything well it's this is
0:30:16.700.700	0:30:21.820.819	allocating capital yeah well right so there's a number of ways where i think that that concern
0:30:21.820.819	0:30:26.860.859	is kind of misplaced so number one if we look at how capital is actually invested in current society
0:30:26.860.859	0:30:32.940.940	and there's a lot of papers on this is um most kind of liquid capital that's invested is passively
0:30:32.940.940	0:30:37.500.500	invested right it's like people that aren't even making any sort of an active decision with how they're
0:30:37.500.500	0:30:42.700.700	investing their capital right so in some sense you could say by transitioning a great bulk of that
0:30:42.700.700	0:30:47.100.099	market you know if we just were to like neutrally buy assets so for every one asset that we buy
0:30:47.100.099	0:30:51.740.740	that's actively managed another one's passively managed um and economists have said that this
0:30:51.740.740	0:30:56.060.059	passive investment is kind of a problem for the allocated process we're kind of transitioning to
0:30:56.060.059	0:31:04.060.059	a more actively managed market in the first place i don't know if i agree with that that most
0:31:04.060.059	0:31:09.900.900	capital that is allocated today is allocated passively the lick the lick like the liquid capital
0:31:09.900.900	0:31:13.340.339	right so these are most of the assets that are managed by these institutional investors like the
0:31:13.340.339	0:31:19.260.259	overwhelming portfolio what do we mean when we say passively managed so when you pass well i mean
0:31:19.260.259	0:31:23.100.099	you know what passive management is right so like passive management is when you would just invest
0:31:23.100.099	0:31:28.220.220	money that essentially just tracks an index on behalf of you know it's essentially managed by the asset
0:31:28.220.220	0:31:32.620.619	holding corporation right it's not really something that you're going out and sort of trying to
0:31:32.620.619	0:31:37.180.180	find you know the the uh the the the actual good investments out there you're just kind of
0:31:37.180.180	0:31:41.820.819	free riding off of all the other allocations that are happening actively sure so i feel like it's
0:31:41.820.819	0:31:47.020.019	we can call it passive management but isn't that kind of like one layer removed because the funds that
0:31:47.020.019	0:31:52.060.059	you're tracking are index funds that are that are kind of being managed by people that are you know
0:31:52.060.059	0:31:56.060.059	trying to pick like a good assortment of funds within a particular index and then the index itself can
0:31:56.060.059	0:32:00.460.460	change based on market capitalization companies and it like it is like passively managed in the same
0:32:00.460.460	0:32:05.260.259	way that like if i give money to an ice cream maker i'm like passively giving that money and i'm not
0:32:05.260.259	0:32:07.900.900	actually making my ice cream but a guy that's getting the money is actively making the ice
0:32:07.900.900	0:32:13.340.339	cream right well well there's a lot of papers on how this is like an allocated distortion right
0:32:13.340.339	0:32:17.420.420	because when you essentially it makes it to where there's not as much actual entrepreneurial
0:32:17.420.420	0:32:22.300.299	investing activity and you're in theory you're increasing the risk of improper allocation of
0:32:22.300.299	0:32:27.260.259	capital because you're sort of necessarily lowering the amount of actual active investing
0:32:27.260.259	0:32:31.820.819	that people are doing when they're going out and trying to search for the best investments and so
0:32:31.820.819	0:32:37.340.339	the holding corporations by engaging in an active management process are kind of um you know effectively
0:32:37.340.339	0:32:42.220.220	solving that problem on by some great proportion and ideally leading to better allocative efficiency
0:32:42.220.220	0:32:47.580.579	because again i i do advocate for very strict technocratic management of these assets um it you
0:32:47.580.579	0:32:52.780.779	know in general um just the last thing just one more thing the last thing that i haven't been able to
0:32:52.780.779	0:32:59.180.180	say is that um you you keep on saying that um the decision making process of like you know capital
0:32:59.180.180	0:33:03.420.420	moving in certain places when they see market activity again like that that whole competitive
0:33:03.420.420	0:33:08.860.859	process between these asset managers is still internalized into my system that these big asset
0:33:08.860.859	0:33:13.180.180	managers that are now publicly owned would have the same competitive dynamics and incentives to do the
0:33:13.180.180	0:33:17.980.980	exact same thing under my system as they do under our current system they'd have the profit motive
0:33:17.980.980	0:33:21.980.980	market dynamics well that's the thing that i don't understand is that's why i keep asking how these
0:33:21.980.980	0:33:25.820.819	are created because i don't think they would have that same um i don't know how they would have that
0:33:25.820.819	0:33:30.220.220	same incentive like if there are five holding corporations i still don't know how you pick
0:33:30.220.220	0:33:35.340.339	five or how five are created um like it so if one underperforms do you eliminate it now there are four
0:33:35.340.339	0:33:41.020.019	or do you spin up a new one or yeah i feel like i've already answered this so so wait wait wait let me
0:33:41.020.019	0:33:44.620.619	ask this very very quickly okay i'm sorry hold on because i feel like you haven't answered this at
0:33:44.620.619	0:33:47.660.660	all and it keeps getting your spoke around i don't know if it's in touch right all right so let's say
0:33:47.660.660	0:33:52.380.380	that okay so let's say that we are um so we we are restructuring our economy in a way that we want
0:33:52.380.380	0:33:55.660.660	to have these public holding corporations okay so what we do is we have the government that has like
0:33:55.660.660	0:34:00.700.700	a big bucket of money and the government is going to allocate its money to these private holding
0:34:00.700.700	0:34:04.220.220	or not private it's going to allocate money to these holding corporations and then they're going to
0:34:04.220.220	0:34:08.540.539	basically serve as all of these massive asset managers like blackrock is you're creating black
0:34:08.540.539	0:34:12.220.219	rocks basically that the government is giving money to for the initial capitalization and then they're
0:34:12.220.219	0:34:16.620.619	going to be investing in individual firms and then their metrics are going to be tracked by um you
0:34:16.620.619	0:34:21.820.820	know profit and all that what i'm asking is where do those initial holding companies come from how do you
0:34:21.820.820	0:34:25.180.179	create those initial holding companies like if there are two or ten what is the difference yeah
0:34:26.140.139	0:34:31.660.659	okay so um i so the the three different ways that i described you have tax money you have
0:34:31.660.659	0:34:35.660.659	essentially quantitative easing no no no i understand you're talking about how you capitalize
0:34:35.660.659	0:34:41.020.019	it i'm talking about how you create them how you create them vote on them like so if i wanted a puppy
0:34:41.020.019	0:34:48.380.380	killing uh holding corporation and destiny wanted a uh uh i don't know a discord dm privacy lock
0:34:48.380.380	0:34:54.220.219	safe guarantee holding corporations like okay yeah yeah so the way yeah so i've already okay i vote on
0:34:55.180.179	0:35:00.780.780	okay so i've advocated for this and i'll say again i'll try to say it more clearly for a rules-based
0:35:00.780.780	0:35:06.700.699	kind of superstructure process for doing that so what do i mean by that okay um for for instance
0:35:06.700.699	0:35:10.460.460	right the federal reserve we have like the board of governors you know and different presidents kind
0:35:10.460.460	0:35:14.780.780	of appoint the board of government no no no no no no no federal reserve has two mandates that aren't
0:35:14.780.780	0:35:18.780.780	tied to like the private the profit motive or aren't tied and like it's a one thing as an example
0:35:18.780.780	0:35:21.900.900	no i understand but i'm not saying it's exactly the same i'm not i know you're saying it's the
0:35:21.900.900	0:35:25.020.019	same i'm saying it's disanalogous because you only have one federal reserve we're not talking about
0:35:25.020.019	0:35:28.700.699	creating multiple federal reserves and their goal isn't to make money or pick winners or losers
0:35:28.700.699	0:35:34.540.539	a superstructure right so again you might have a superstructure so all the different holding
0:35:34.540.539	0:35:38.140.139	corporations would have their own boards that are appointed right by the public by this kind
0:35:38.140.139	0:35:42.060.059	of rules-based process but then you might have a superstructure that says okay like this is the
0:35:42.060.059	0:35:46.300.300	general guidance we would give the firms this is how much wealth we've accumulated in our financial
0:35:46.300.300	0:35:50.220.219	assets from our sovereign wealth fund hey we think it's time now to vote on whether or not to
0:35:50.220.219	0:35:53.420.420	open a new public holding corporation because oh we've got five trillion dollars in our sovereign
0:35:53.420.420	0:35:57.980.980	wealth fund let's do another trillion dollar like holding corporation recapitalize it similar to
0:35:57.980.980	0:36:01.340.340	this kind of broad superstructure of competing holding corporations that we have
0:36:01.340.340	0:36:07.020.019	so i hope i just i just that's a completely direct answer to that question i think there'd
0:36:07.020.019	0:36:11.740.739	probably be some kind of superstructure rules-based independent technocratic management process
0:36:11.740.739	0:36:16.300.300	for determining how to capitalize new holding corporations to answer the other question you asked
0:36:16.300.300	0:36:22.780.780	about what happens to um firms that fail um the same thing that happens to firms that fail today right
0:36:22.780.780	0:36:27.180.179	like i believe in hard budget constraints once they're capitalized you're on your own you've got
0:36:27.180.179	0:36:31.260.260	to compete in the market you have to survive you have to do what you got to do to basically you
0:36:31.260.260	0:36:35.180.179	know earn a living right and if these holding corporations were to go bankrupt then they have
0:36:35.180.179	0:36:40.780.780	to go through the ordinary bankrupt process the the goal of any portfolio is uh and this is for the
0:36:40.780.780	0:36:44.700.699	audience because i'm sure you understand this is that the goal for any portfolio is not for any
0:36:44.700.699	0:36:49.580.579	for every single investment that you make to succeed at all times it's just to have a weighted
0:36:49.580.579	0:36:54.220.219	risk-adjusted portfolio so that you're not overly exposed to any one thing to the extent that
0:36:54.220.219	0:36:58.460.460	where if one holding corporation or one investment within a holding corporation goes bust you have
0:36:58.460.460	0:37:02.380.380	enough of a diversified investment pool that you're still getting a lot of returns for the
0:37:02.380.380	0:37:07.180.179	public a lot of returns from your portfolio at large okay and then that i guess i just want to let the
0:37:07.180.179	0:37:11.180.179	record reflect i am not happy with the superstructure answer but i i accept it i'll move on to the next
0:37:11.180.179	0:37:17.420.420	thing um i'm just curious how do these holding corporations how do they engage with a i don't know
0:37:17.420.420	0:37:21.820.820	what we would call these firms are they private firms like would an individual go to a holding
0:37:21.820.820	0:37:26.780.780	corporation to say i want to start a business that uh manages electricians and then the firm might
0:37:26.780.780	0:37:30.540.539	invest in that business or the holding company might i'm sorry the holding company might invest
0:37:30.540.539	0:37:33.740.739	in that firm or like what does the ownership structure of these individual firms look like
0:37:33.740.739	0:37:39.420.420	that the holding companies invest in yeah yeah so they would so they would start out you know and i
0:37:39.420.420	0:37:43.740.739	think throughout the process of transition until we get the total socialization the process would look
0:37:43.740.739	0:37:48.140.139	very similar to what it looks like now where people would be able to people would be able to just go
0:37:48.140.139	0:37:53.420.420	out and start businesses and you know decide the ownership structure for however they wanted um i
0:37:53.420.420	0:37:57.100.099	think that where the holding corporations would wait wait wait wait you keep closing people can't
0:37:57.100.099	0:38:01.580.579	start businesses in your model though because the capital is all managed by the holding corporations
0:38:01.580.579	0:38:05.980.980	right well no no because again there's there's a there's a huge transitionary period where there's
0:38:05.980.980	0:38:10.140.139	ignore the let's ignore the transitionary period and let's say that we're past it into your kind of
0:38:10.140.139	0:38:15.580.579	more um towards much closer to your ideal model it's not individual starting businesses it has to be the
0:38:15.580.579	0:38:22.540.539	uh well yeah yeah so if individuals wanted to if individuals in an ideal system right so again i do
0:38:22.540.539	0:38:27.420.420	think that in like complete social ownership there's as matt brunick told you in your conversation with
0:38:27.420.420	0:38:32.620.619	him there's like genuinely sticky issues as to like how exactly would you socialize the whole entire
0:38:32.620.619	0:38:37.340.340	economy i can tell you what i would maybe imagine would happen so um number one i think that you'd
0:38:37.340.340	0:38:42.460.460	probably still allow for some amount of retail investing because if you're just like a sole proprietor i
0:38:42.460.460	0:38:45.980.980	don't think most socialists have huge problems with like sole proprietorships if you just want
0:38:45.980.980	0:38:49.980.980	to go and trade stock so you'd still have that quarter of the market that's kind of like retail
0:38:49.980.980	0:38:54.220.219	invested and then other than that what you would do to start a business is you would probably go to the
0:38:54.220.219	0:38:58.300.300	holding corporation i don't hold on wait i don't understand when you stole proprietorship has retail
0:38:58.300.300	0:39:01.420.420	investing i don't know what these things have to do with each other if i want to hire employees
0:39:01.420.420	0:39:05.900.900	that would basically be disallowed in your system wouldn't it be well retail i mean if you're a
0:39:05.900.900	0:39:09.980.980	retail investor i mean typically i think when we when we talk about like retail investing we're talking
0:39:09.980.980	0:39:13.660.659	about just individuals no no i understand i know there's retail investors versus institutional
0:39:13.660.659	0:39:16.780.780	investors i'm not talking about the investment part i'm talking about the firms themselves and
0:39:16.780.780	0:39:21.260.260	the ownership structure i can't in your idealized version i can't walk out and hire employees to
0:39:21.260.260	0:39:27.820.820	start a business right yeah yeah so in a total idealized system which again i have a hard time
0:39:27.820.820	0:39:32.940.940	imagining i i think that we can get to like 75 social ownership and then you know again these
0:39:32.940.940	0:39:37.500.500	genuinely sticky issues come up which i think are very relevant criticisms to point out but
0:39:37.500.500	0:39:41.340.340	um i can tell you kind of what i would roughly imagine you know i i think that if you were going
0:39:41.340.340	0:39:46.620.619	to go out and start a business um you know you'd probably have to engage in the state in some way
0:39:46.620.619	0:39:51.420.420	like you'd have to sell like a portion of your equity over time or you know maybe you could go
0:39:51.420.420	0:39:56.460.460	out and try to raise funds from other retail investors that would be able to offer you some
0:39:56.460.460	0:40:01.260.260	amount of money or maybe you'd have to rely on lending in some sort um you know something like that
0:40:01.260.260	0:40:06.940.940	but i i think that once you try to go for like a very very rigid model it becomes very very hard to kind of
0:40:06.940.940	0:40:13.180.179	imagine what that process would look like at least to me okay well i'm i'm unsatisfied with the answer
0:40:13.180.179	0:40:22.290.289	but i will accept it okay i i guess yeah i i'm unsatisfied too i i just i you keep switching
0:40:22.290.289	0:40:26.210.210	a kind of boy and i don't mean to double team you here right but you keep switching between well
0:40:26.210.210	0:40:31.970.969	there's a transitionary period where the rules would be x but then i want y where the rules would be
0:40:31.970.969	0:40:39.170.170	something else and well right so i mean we could talk about i think what what so again let me just
0:40:39.170.170	0:40:43.010.010	ask the question yeah just let me answer the question directly okay i will i'll imagine
0:40:43.490.489	0:40:49.090.090	an ideal in-state right so what we might imagine is that you still have about you know what we have
0:40:49.090.090	0:40:53.490.489	now we have like 25 retail investors they're still just doing their little individual investing i
0:40:53.490.489	0:40:56.850.849	don't think that it's i mean my socialism i guess i don't really care if people individually
0:40:56.850.849	0:41:01.090.090	go out and invest money if they want now other than that it's like okay well how do you start a
0:41:01.090.090	0:41:05.890.889	business well i guess that that entire process could be socialized within the holding corporations
0:41:05.890.889	0:41:09.810.809	themselves where it would basically be these holding corporations deciding what to invest
0:41:09.810.809	0:41:13.970.969	in and why and they would be competing against each other to do the exact same thing now if an
0:41:13.970.969	0:41:18.290.289	individual like you guys are describing like hey an individual wants to go out and start a business
0:41:18.290.289	0:41:22.850.849	well i guess you'd have to basically go to the holding corporations and convince them to capitalize
0:41:23.890.889	0:41:29.570.570	yeah you have to convince like it's a standalone yeah yeah well well it's independently managed
0:41:29.570.570	0:41:33.170.170	from the government but ultimately the public would be the shareholders right yeah you have to go
0:41:34.130.130	0:41:38.930.929	the government gets to decide who's on these holding corporations etc well yeah but wick i there's a
0:41:38.930.929	0:41:43.330.329	huge difference between you've got to go to a government bureaucrat and you have to go to a
0:41:43.330.329	0:41:49.250.250	technocratically managed asset manager right like it's like the difference between so well it's it's
0:41:49.250.250	0:41:54.050.050	an independent agency right so ideally it wouldn't be like strictly beholden to like any one government
0:41:54.050.050	0:41:58.210.210	right it would have its sort of independent rules-based system that it follows now obviously the
0:41:58.210.210	0:42:02.610.610	government can you know around the edges i think make some reforms if they want i mean we do have
0:42:02.610.610	0:42:06.610.610	a democracy after all it wouldn't be like a 100 independent thing but yeah if you wanted to start
0:42:06.610.610	0:42:10.690.690	a business you basically have to go to the holding corporation and convince them to capitalize that
0:42:10.690.690	0:42:15.730.730	business and invest in it um you know similar to how people have to go to asset managers today
0:42:15.730.730	0:42:19.010.010	the only difference well i guess not you know not to minimize it but you know the only difference
0:42:19.010.010	0:42:22.850.849	would be that that would be essentially like your only option you'd have to go to either a bank or one
0:42:22.850.849	0:42:26.610.610	of these holding corporations um or you'd have to be a retail investor just doing the same thing
0:42:26.610.610	0:42:37.140.139	right and in a system like that you know i think that we uh you know i think there's a good reason
0:42:37.140.139	0:42:42.020.019	to think that even in that kind of idealist version of our system we would have great levels of equality
0:42:42.020.019	0:42:47.220.219	we'd get trillions of dollars of dividend payments to you know use for public purposes that we wanted
0:42:47.860.860	0:42:52.100.099	and i think that the allocation process fundamentally would be very sound because again the allocation
0:42:52.100.099	0:42:58.900.900	process looks extremely similar to the allocation process that we have today under our current kind of
0:42:58.900.900	0:43:03.700.699	asset managers um and lastly what i would argue is that you know look i think that a more egalitarian
0:43:03.700.699	0:43:08.260.260	system in many ways is substantially more entrepreneurial than our current system right
0:43:08.260.260	0:43:11.940.940	you know a lot of these billionaires who talk about how they started their businesses they don't say you
0:43:11.940.940	0:43:16.500.500	know oh i got 10 billion dollars from my dad and that's how i started my 10 billion dollar factory
0:43:16.500.500	0:43:20.740.739	right it's like oh i started in a garage i got you know trump says i got a small loan of a million
0:43:20.740.739	0:43:24.660.659	dollars well obviously if we horizontalize a lot of that capital and have this much greater
0:43:24.660.659	0:43:29.140.139	equality of opportunity then ideally there'd be a lot more people that are able to actually live up
0:43:29.140.139	0:43:37.060.059	to their full capabilities in my system versus the current system that we have now okay i guess a couple
0:43:37.060.059	0:43:46.580.579	questions for for both of you in this point right so to destiny first i guess um what in principle
0:43:46.580.579	0:43:56.020.019	okay is the difference about uh democratically voting to raise taxes um uh and democratically voting for
0:43:56.020.019	0:44:04.340.340	other forms of expert expropriation yeah what's this word expropriation thank you uh for property
0:44:04.340.340	0:44:09.780.780	like what's it what's the difference between this so for example what in principle can allows you to compel
0:44:09.780.780	0:44:15.700.699	a company to turn over a percentage of its profits versus more like what econoboy is talking about where
0:44:16.580.579	0:44:20.820.820	the government compels you to work through these holding companies to do your business um i think
0:44:20.820.820	0:44:25.860.860	was this a dono no this is just a question oh there's i've got my chat that's been this question
0:44:25.860.860	0:44:31.540.539	50 trillion times um i think expropriation is meaningfully different than um uh than taxes
0:44:31.540.539	0:44:34.980.980	because i feel like when people talk about expropriation you're typically talking about
0:44:34.980.980	0:44:40.340.340	taking like a thing that the person will no longer have access to usually you're talking about a form of
0:44:40.340.340	0:44:44.500.500	like a thing like an actual physical like a building or something else you're taking that um taxes are
0:44:44.500.500	0:44:50.180.179	generally like surplus thing like they're applied to profits it's not like uh you're taxing my revenues
0:44:50.180.179	0:44:52.740.739	and i don't even have money to pay my bills and the government's coming after something and now
0:44:52.740.739	0:44:56.980.980	they're going to take my property my buildings or whatever so generally taxes are applied to profits
0:44:56.980.980	0:45:01.940.940	so excesses money things that are like fungible and expropriation is usually tied to things that
0:45:01.940.940	0:45:05.700.699	are not fungible and it's like taking an irreplaceable thing from you i think they're i think
0:45:05.700.699	0:45:13.060.059	they're meaningfully different things okay fair enough uh to you econoboy is there such a thing
0:45:13.780.780	0:45:22.980.980	and uh if there is can you kind of walk me through it um a liberal socialism like how
0:45:23.940.940	0:45:31.140.139	is liberalism in your mind compatible with the uh economic model you just kind of laid out there
0:45:31.140.139	0:45:36.260.260	yeah sure sure um number one i do i do want to challenge i do want to challenge destiny and also
0:45:36.260.260	0:45:42.420.420	you wick um to um because i i just don't i don't find i i'm not hearing much in terms of concrete
0:45:42.420.420	0:45:49.860.860	reasons why my model would be like deeply allocatedly inefficient or there's okay wick there's nothing
0:45:49.860.860	0:45:54.020.019	vague about what i'm saying i'm saying we'd have like we have all these asset managers now
0:45:54.020.019	0:45:58.500.500	just imagine a system where they're all public instead of privately owned okay imagine that right
0:45:58.500.500	0:46:02.740.739	like that's that's that's the complete and if you just literally don't understand how capital is
0:46:02.740.739	0:46:07.540.539	allocated in our system and so you have no conception of what that looks like just say that wick but
0:46:07.540.539	0:46:11.300.300	don't say i'm not being specific god damn it sorry i got also the thing well it doesn't make sense
0:46:11.300.300	0:46:14.580.579	to say that they're sure i'll answer the viewers question after you respond i'll see sorry or go
0:46:14.580.579	0:46:20.820.820	ahead you can answer the question wait yeah anyway so i just i i do actually want to learn like i just
0:46:20.820.820	0:46:24.580.579	oh it just i just i hear a lot of oh it just seems like it doesn't oh i want to you know get into
0:46:24.580.579	0:46:29.700.699	that tell me why so on the answer of um can you have a liberal socialism so yes i think that i i
0:46:29.700.699	0:46:34.500.500	think that for the most part i think liberalism is defined by individual rights um political equality
0:46:34.500.500	0:46:39.140.139	things like that i i don't think liberalism is necessarily defined by uh you know in large
0:46:39.140.139	0:46:42.820.820	majority part the ability to start a private business um i think there's a reason why you
0:46:42.820.820	0:46:49.700.699	know uh famous kind of uh historical uh liberal uh j.s mill he endorsed socialism at the end of his
0:46:49.700.699	0:46:53.540.539	life even though he was a very committed liberal for his time um and obviously had an incomplete
0:46:53.540.539	0:46:57.780.780	view of liberalism himself but even like contemporary liberalism probably the most famous liberal thinker
0:46:57.780.780	0:47:03.460.460	contemporarily is john rawls and rawls also endorsed socialism right rawl said that the you know you can
0:47:03.460.460	0:47:08.260.260	certainly achieve liberal ideals with a democratic socialist system um and he thought that because
0:47:08.260.260	0:47:12.340.340	again you know the things about political equality and individual rights like there's nothing
0:47:12.340.340	0:47:16.580.579	necessarily incompatible with socialism and the idea of having essentially political equality and
0:47:16.580.579	0:47:20.580.579	individual rights right like i don't think my system would abolish free speech i don't think my system
0:47:20.580.579	0:47:26.100.099	would not be democratic in nature um i've already said hey if people just like don't want to do what
0:47:26.100.099	0:47:30.260.260	i'm suggesting we'll vote against it you know i don't know i'm not going to force anybody to do
0:47:30.260.260	0:47:36.980.980	anything so um anyway so that's uh that's uh kind of what i'm uh describing ultimately okay you had
0:47:36.980.980	0:47:42.740.739	something to say destiny yeah so i okay so i feel like the challenge is that you say that you're answering
0:47:42.740.739	0:47:49.700.699	questions but every time you answer the question we we are that we package all of the really difficult things
0:47:49.700.699	0:47:54.820.820	into this like phrase of like an ambiguous superstructure or like the rules or some crazy rule
0:47:54.820.820	0:48:03.220.219	set and i was like okay that's that the hello we still here hello what just happened we did it not
0:48:03.220.219	0:48:07.300.300	okay i'm gonna start over it feels like the issue is every time i try to like figure out how like any
0:48:07.300.300	0:48:14.180.179	of these things are wait is it working hello no it is you guys are here go for it go for it okay yeah i
0:48:14.180.179	0:48:17.460.460	feel like we get like the answer is like oh well there would be rules to take care of that and it's like
0:48:17.460.460	0:48:22.900.900	those rules i think are pretty important um it also seems like we're at the end of the day um when
0:48:22.900.900	0:48:29.300.300	we start to drill it down into this all we've done is we've basically created capitalism with like a
0:48:29.300.300	0:48:34.420.420	different tax structure so for instance i'm very confused you're advocating for a system of socialism
0:48:34.420.420	0:48:39.460.460	where individuals can still start firms on their own and then scrape excesses from the
0:48:40.020.019	0:48:44.180.179	surplus value created by their employees that's that's a very strange the only difference is we're just
0:48:44.900.900	0:48:49.540.539	the the initial investment comes from holding corporations that are capitalized with public
0:48:49.540.539	0:48:53.540.539	funds is that the answer is that like if i wanted to start a business am i allowed to hire employees
0:48:54.420.420	0:49:00.100.099	okay so i i feel okay so originally the it's like well economy i'm not gonna make you just completely
0:49:00.100.099	0:49:04.500.500	totally lay out a 500 page document of how exactly this works and so what i what i answered your
0:49:04.500.500	0:49:08.580.579	question was let's just imagine that it's a committee superstructure where hey we've accumulated 10
0:49:08.580.579	0:49:12.260.260	trillion dollars of a sovereign wealth fund we're going to take one trillion of that and do one
0:49:12.260.260	0:49:17.700.699	new holding corporation that now has to go out and invest i think that is i think that wick
0:49:17.700.699	0:49:23.540.539	is pretty specific on how the holding yeah wait nothing nothing that you just said there had anything
0:49:23.540.539	0:49:28.660.659	to do with my question and also i don't want to draw you informed and i just know our employees can
0:49:28.660.659	0:49:34.100.099	you hire employees are you allowed to do that okay so if the new question is not how do you hold how do
0:49:34.100.099	0:49:39.940.940	you fund or do the holding corporations but can you hire employees all the way just to be clear before you
0:49:39.940.940	0:49:43.460.460	said that mike we can go back in the video my question was literally just are you allowed to
0:49:43.460.460	0:49:48.100.099	hire employees that was my question wait okay destiny are you claiming you didn't ask me a hundred times
0:49:48.100.099	0:49:51.860.860	how did the new holding corporations get formed though that wasn't a question that was a mainstay
0:49:51.860.860	0:49:59.250.250	that you've asked i mean really like come on you asked that like five or ten times and i feel like
0:49:59.250.250	0:50:04.930.929	we've been circling the drain on that give me one second hold on all right give me a second go for it
0:50:04.930.929	0:50:16.580.579	you hold how do you fund or do the holding okay formed and i the holding take one just imagine the
0:50:16.580.579	0:50:19.700.699	so originally sir is that like investment comes from are you created by their employees
0:50:21.140.139	0:50:25.940.940	still start firms on their own and then scrape excesses from the surplus value create so for
0:50:25.940.940	0:50:28.980.980	instance i'm very confused you're advocating for a system of socialism where individuals can still
0:50:28.980.980	0:50:32.900.900	start firms on their own and then scrape excesses from the surplus value created by their employees
0:50:32.900.900	0:50:36.500.500	that's that's very strange the only difference is we're just the initial investment comes from
0:50:36.500.500	0:50:39.220.219	holding corporations that are capitalized with public funds is that the answer is that like if
0:50:39.220.219	0:50:45.470.469	i wanted to start a business am i allowed to hire employees how would you hire employees and i said
0:50:45.470.469	0:50:49.150.150	well you probably have retail investors that would just individual sole proprietors i realized so my
0:50:49.150.150	0:50:53.150.150	employees so my question was that you wanted to hire i'm just asking like how how can you
0:50:53.950.949	0:50:59.630.630	i'm asking if you can hire employees that was my question yes okay so i'm gonna if any of you dicks
0:50:59.630.630	0:51:04.510.510	say i'm not answering this question directly i'm going to myself on stream in a video game okay
0:51:04.510.510	0:51:13.790.789	so can you hire employees in my ideal system yes the answer is no you would have to go to the capital
0:51:13.790.789	0:51:19.230.230	owners which are the public in this case and get them to capitalize your business and you'd have to
0:51:19.230.230	0:51:22.910.909	have a shared ownership structure i've said wait wait wait just to be clear hold on you're not saying
0:51:22.910.909	0:51:26.830.829	you go to the public you would go to the holding corporations that are ran by technocrats holding
0:51:26.830.829	0:51:30.350.349	corporations i'm just saying the public because wick gets triggered oh it's actually the state it's
0:51:30.350.349	0:51:32.990.989	actually the government well no but there's a meaningful difference there because you're saying
0:51:32.990.989	0:51:35.950.949	that the holding corporations be competing against each other so you kind of solve for your market
0:51:35.950.949	0:51:38.510.510	inefficiencies there by just calling it the government so i'm being more i'm trying to be
0:51:38.510.510	0:51:42.270.269	more charitable to your model you're saying you're being more charitable wick is being the dumbass
0:51:42.270.269	0:51:47.870.869	in this conversation sorry wick i love you but jesus christ okay okay dumbass everyone goes after the ref
0:51:47.870.869	0:51:52.190.190	okay so so i'm just trying to figure out as an individual right now if i want to start a business
0:51:52.190.190	0:51:57.150.150	okay i can hire employees and and and get initial capital to pay them and and sell products and
0:51:57.150.150	0:52:01.550.550	stuff right that's how we do business but in in your world so i would have to like i'm just trying
0:52:01.550.550	0:52:06.030.030	to figure i don't even know what the process would look like of getting employees or how or because i
0:52:06.030.030	0:52:09.950.949	can't start a business on my own what would it even mean to start a business are you even allowed to
0:52:09.950.949	0:52:12.830.829	start a business or would it just be me and five other people who would say we all want to be plumbers
0:52:12.830.829	0:52:17.470.469	can somebody else make a business again this is the ideal system and which is i think to me a
0:52:17.470.469	0:52:20.590.590	little bit harder to imagine but yeah on the ideal system i think you'd have you'd essentially be
0:52:20.590.590	0:52:24.990.989	like the leader of the organization you'd be like the ceo and not necessarily the sole owner of the
0:52:24.990.989	0:52:28.750.750	business and i think that that's you know the main difference but you'd go in and you'd convince the
0:52:28.750.750	0:52:32.910.909	public holding corporation hey like for instance though oh i've i'm an engineer who worked in the
0:52:32.910.909	0:52:37.390.389	oil field services industry for 10 years i think i could start an oil field service businesses here's
0:52:37.390.389	0:52:41.870.869	my kind of like my business plan i think that this is the salary i deserve because i'm the ceo
0:52:41.870.869	0:52:46.270.269	um and you know the public holding corporation would say you know what that sounds like a good idea here's
0:52:46.270.269	0:52:49.950.949	two million dollars go out and make a bunch of money and you know here's some performance pay or
0:52:49.950.949	0:52:54.590.590	whatever it'd be a very similar system again it's just that the ownership structure would be public
0:52:54.590.590	0:52:58.750.750	instead of private and that's a that's a very specific example i hope that i hope that is a
0:52:59.310.309	0:53:05.150.150	really concrete just you can laugh the oil field services example that's pretty concrete if you
0:53:05.150.150	0:53:10.830.829	ask me in terms of imagining what it would look like gotcha okay so then for the month for for
0:53:10.830.829	0:53:15.470.469	compensation how are we getting to our more kind of like egalitarian world if the guy's being
0:53:15.470.469	0:53:19.230.230	compensated like so much more as like the owner or like the leader of the company i'm sorry not the
0:53:19.230.230	0:53:23.070.070	leader of the company are we also like taxing the additional money that he makes more or
0:53:23.070.070	0:53:28.350.349	so yeah so you would have a fiscal state that you tax the income and you would redistribute in the
0:53:28.350.349	0:53:32.350.349	form of welfare payments um the reason why you're getting a lot more egalitarianism like i said is
0:53:32.350.349	0:53:37.230.230	because the fundamental problem in our capitalist system is the private ownership of wealth and the
0:53:37.230.230	0:53:44.190.190	capital income from wealth um and so that would be uh essentially horizontally distributed in my system
0:53:44.190.190	0:53:48.430.429	obviously the ceo would still make you know there'd be a multiple in terms of how the ceo is paid
0:53:48.430.429	0:53:53.230.230	relative to the lowest paid employee but you know there wouldn't be uh this kind of huge differentiation
0:53:53.230.230	0:53:59.230.230	of capital income and uh public wealth and uh i say total wealth in society sure so what's the
0:53:59.230.230	0:54:05.310.309	difference between you're saying that the capital income would be more horizontally distributed through
0:54:05.310.309	0:54:09.390.389	some kind of welfare policy what's in between that and just like more taxes in our current system
0:54:10.830.829	0:54:15.710.710	so the difference would be that number one my system is highly efficient relative to just raising
0:54:15.710.710	0:54:22.110.110	taxes to some crazy amount um so obviously we could just raise taxes to you know greatly greatly lower
0:54:22.110.110	0:54:26.910.909	the amount of wealth inequality by like raising a wealth tax but wealth taxes are bad for the economy
0:54:26.910.909	0:54:32.030.030	right like wealth taxes seem to destroy investment which isn't really good um my system would you know
0:54:32.030.030	0:54:36.830.829	in a number of ways i think incentivize investment or incentivize productivity gains which i've mentioned
0:54:36.830.829	0:54:41.950.949	before um and then with regards to uh capital income right so instead of having to tax corporations
0:54:41.950.949	0:54:46.590.590	there's so much evidence on taxing corporations and taxing capital income there's all of these kind
0:54:46.590.590	0:54:52.750.750	of uh you know these flight problems and these problems with um uh adherence essentially but you
0:54:52.750.750	0:54:56.830.829	wouldn't get that if all of these things were directly publicly owned obviously you just directly
0:54:56.830.829	0:55:01.790.789	send the payments like when i own stock in apple i don't have a problem getting capital income from apple
0:55:01.790.789	0:55:07.150.150	they willingly give it to me but if i try to tax apple you know 20 they're going to do everything
0:55:07.150.150	0:55:12.670.670	they possibly can do to basically avoid paying that tax as much as possible don't you run into a similar
0:55:12.670.670	0:55:16.190.190	problem though if you have competing holding companies like let's say i want to be the leader
0:55:16.190.190	0:55:20.110.110	of the oil engineering company that i'm doing but i want to get paid since i know i'm going to be
0:55:20.110.110	0:55:24.830.829	horizontally distributed for my profits or whatever i want to be compensated 20 million dollars wouldn't
0:55:24.830.829	0:55:28.110.110	i go from holding company to holding company and they would compete in the same way that you do
0:55:28.110.110	0:55:31.390.389	in a capital market right now for high ceo compensation wouldn't that be like an even greater
0:55:31.390.389	0:55:35.150.150	problem since now the ceo's not even compensated with ownership but has to be compensated directly with wages
0:55:35.150.150	0:55:41.390.389	yeah well currently um so yeah so i'm arguing for more of a cash compensation basis but again the the
0:55:41.390.389	0:55:45.470.469	the cash doesn't accumulate quite like capital does right so you still have this kind of great
0:55:45.470.469	0:55:50.910.909	horizontalization of public wealth um now people in my society could still be rich relative to others
0:55:50.910.909	0:55:55.790.789	but there's a big difference between you know the top 10 percent owns 20 of the wealth and the top
0:55:55.790.789	0:55:59.230.230	10 percent owns two-thirds of the wealth like they do in our current society and there's a big
0:55:59.230.230	0:56:03.310.309	difference between the top 10 percent has like what you're let's just call it capital income because
0:56:03.310.309	0:56:08.510.510	that's kind of what you're describing like the top 10 has 25 of capital income and the top 10
0:56:08.510.510	0:56:12.910.909	has 90 of capital income which is about what it is in our current society so i'm not saying my society
0:56:12.910.909	0:56:17.150.150	would have perfect equality um it's hard for me to conceive of a society with perfect equality but it
0:56:17.150.150	0:56:24.990.989	would have much more equality than we have now okay i i feel like like boosting all of our tax brackets
0:56:24.990.989	0:56:29.710.710	by 15 points i think is almost inconceivable but i think that would be more realistic and i feel like
0:56:29.710.710	0:56:35.550.550	it would affect better outcomes than this entirely new idealized system that would obviously be
0:56:35.550.550	0:56:40.430.429	incredibly difficult to move to that i think we don't really have any strong evidence of it even
0:56:40.430.429	0:56:45.630.630	being possible well we do have strong evidence of not of the ideal system but we don't we also don't
0:56:45.630.630	0:56:49.150.150	have an ideal tax code but that doesn't stop center-left people from saying that we need things
0:56:49.150.150	0:56:53.710.710	like a land value tax or these kind of like zoning reforms these kind of like hyper yumbia stuff i believe
0:56:53.710.710	0:56:58.830.829	in all that stuff too you know no government has a perfect tax code or even close to it but i think it's
0:56:58.830.829	0:57:02.430.429	still good to advocate for i think on you know principles and what we can say about what we know
0:57:02.430.429	0:57:06.350.349	about taxes it would be a good thing and certainly i think that there's a lot of examples of public
0:57:06.350.349	0:57:09.710.710	wealth and public wealth management that have gone very very well for the people that have lived in
0:57:09.710.710	0:57:14.830.829	those societies and so i'm perfectly willing to say that hey in transition you know economy
0:57:14.830.829	0:57:21.150.150	we got up to 85 you know public wealth ownership and i don't like the transition the transition is like
0:57:21.150.150	0:57:26.270.269	transitioning from being a bodybuilder to somebody who only eats junk food constantly the transition is
0:57:26.270.269	0:57:29.790.789	very boring to me like you can eat whatever you want and have the best body ever if you're just
0:57:29.790.789	0:57:33.150.150	coming off of being a professional bodybuilder and this transition state where we have all the
0:57:33.150.150	0:57:36.990.989	advantages of uh capitalism and all the advantages of all the accrued wealth of all of the innovation
0:57:36.990.989	0:57:40.670.670	everything else and they're saying oh well let's just own all of it like by the state sure expropriation
0:57:40.670.670	0:57:44.110.110	is great on day one but all the issues that you're running into later on is like well how do we decide
0:57:44.110.110	0:57:47.470.469	what to invest in like how are we avoiding all of the problems that we had before it feels like we're
0:57:47.470.469	0:57:51.710.710	kind of like recreating capitalism with even more bureaucratic layers um that i don't know we're
0:57:51.710.710	0:57:56.910.909	guaranteed to have efficient allocation of capital um and we have no like model for this working in
0:57:56.910.909	0:58:00.110.110	the real world right now so the idea that we'd be able to benefit in the same way that we are right
0:58:00.110.110	0:58:04.430.429	now from all the innovation of capitalism but also do the redistribution i just don't find any compelling
0:58:04.430.429	0:58:10.110.110	evidence we don't have we don't have a model of a perfect tax code either or like a perfect liberalism
0:58:10.110.110	0:58:13.470.469	no no hold on there's a difference there's a difference between there's a difference between a more
0:58:13.470.469	0:58:17.710.710	perfect thing that we're moving into direction versus a system overhaul you're talking about a
0:58:17.710.710	0:58:22.670.670	fundamentally different system not like uh tweaking something to make it better than than what it is
0:58:22.670.670	0:58:29.870.869	right now right so well i i don't know i think in some senses i would argue that my my uh plan is
0:58:29.870.869	0:58:35.070.070	a tweak of our current system right i mean because again i try i tried in my system to kind of internalize
0:58:35.070.070	0:58:40.270.269	the same kind of allocative and sort of investment uh the allocated investment process that we currently
0:58:40.270.269	0:58:44.510.510	see today under the same kinds of institutions that we see today you know these asset managers
0:58:44.510.510	0:58:48.750.750	privately owned versus publicly owned right well i think and we see there's i was just going to say
0:58:48.750.750	0:58:54.190.190	one last thing one more sentence is that that we do see a a ton a ton a ton of examples of public
0:58:54.190.190	0:58:58.350.349	wealth accumulation and so i would i would agree i would i fully concede that look we do not know
0:58:58.910.909	0:59:04.590.590	like essentially what the ideal system would actually do right but we have at least good reason to
0:59:04.590.590	0:59:09.710.710	believe that the transition to that ideal system can work out very very well because it already has
0:59:09.710.710	0:59:13.470.469	worked out very very well in these other countries and so i'm saying that for me at least for me
0:59:13.470.469	0:59:18.910.909	personally that's enough evidence to say two things we should definitely try and like transition make
0:59:18.910.909	0:59:23.870.869	that transition because we can make real improvements today and then two insofar as that continues to keep
0:59:23.870.869	0:59:27.870.869	working out we should just keep doing it and we should keep trying to strive towards that ideal and
0:59:27.870.869	0:59:33.070.070	i don't think that's a an insensible way to to think about things or how to label yourself i think so i
0:59:33.070.070	0:59:36.030.030	think it's when i say like entirely different and not just moving in a certain direction so like
0:59:36.030.030	0:59:39.710.710	for instance like in the society that you're talking about if i wanted to start a new if i wanted to
0:59:39.710.710	0:59:43.870.869	start a company and i and none of the technocratic boards or whatever were okay with that company
0:59:43.870.869	0:59:48.110.110	starting i would be disallowed from starting that company in my country i wouldn't be allowed to do
0:59:48.110.110	0:59:54.670.670	that that's i think that again if i wanted let's say that i wanted to start a new firm that makes retro
0:59:54.670.670	1:00:00.590.590	gameboys and none of the technocratic boards are on board with me making my new gameboy manufacturing
1:00:00.590.590	1:00:04.350.349	firm i would be banned from doing that it would be illegal to do that in the new country that we've
1:00:04.350.349	1:00:09.230.230	created well you'd have to yeah you'd have to contract it out in some way right so you wouldn't
1:00:09.230.230	1:00:13.870.869	be able to own the capital yourself but obviously to the extent that manufacturing retro gameboys would
1:00:13.870.869	1:00:19.870.869	just be you know a you know a specialized process of different services that you would need to do in
1:00:19.870.869	1:00:23.630.630	order to do it you know you could create that proof of concept and then again you can have a sole
1:00:23.630.630	1:00:27.790.789	proprietorship where you're the one that actually kind of you know manages this and accumulates it and
1:00:27.790.789	1:00:31.790.789	then goes from there we can't sell the sole proprietorship where i think we're using clever tricks
1:00:31.790.789	1:00:35.630.630	to aware the hard question because if i have a sole proprietorship then could i not just hire
1:00:35.630.630	1:00:40.190.190	10 other 1099 people like you recreated the 1099 model of well they're not my employees they're just
1:00:40.190.190	1:00:46.910.909	other sole proprietors i could just recreate firms using 1099s instead of w-2s and former like c-level
1:00:46.910.909	1:00:50.910.909	structure no like i don't think that's well yeah i mean the way well but that's a that's a question
1:00:50.910.909	1:00:55.310.309	for your regulatory state really so it's like no no no no no no wait no no no no conceptually it's
1:00:55.310.309	1:01:01.630.630	important that you in your world if you can't convince a technocratic board you ban the you ban that
1:01:01.630.630	1:01:04.670.670	you can't just start a company that if you want to if you can't get out on board with it easily i
1:01:04.670.670	1:01:08.270.269	can but i'm saying i can i can easily just hand wave that and just say okay well you you can't
1:01:08.270.269	1:01:12.670.670	there's no 1099 employees right you have to hire like actual companies that exist that are full-time
1:01:12.670.670	1:01:16.430.429	employees like i don't know it seems easy enough to just kind of say that that's a thing or a barrier
1:01:16.430.429	1:01:19.630.630	but i can't hire them because i don't have the money because i don't have capital in this society
1:01:19.630.630	1:01:24.110.110	i'm not allowed to start a business where like hire employees and stuff well in our current society there's
1:01:24.110.110	1:01:27.950.949	a lot of people with great ideas that don't have for money and they can't start any business at
1:01:27.950.949	1:01:31.470.469	all because it's so inegalitarian and that was one of the points that i made earlier is that
1:01:31.870.869	1:01:35.310.309	in my society where people are so much more egalitarian i'm not contesting that i'm not
1:01:35.310.309	1:01:38.830.829	contesting that in your society some people that could make companies that don't have the ability
1:01:38.830.829	1:01:42.270.269	to now might be able to that's obviously true right i'm sure there are some people good ideas i can't
1:01:42.270.269	1:01:45.390.389	raise the money for it but in your society if you did have the money for a business that you wanted
1:01:45.390.389	1:01:48.590.590	to start but you couldn't get any of these giant holding companies on board with it you would be
1:01:48.590.590	1:01:54.750.750	disallowed from doing so well no no so you said two different things there right so you said um if i don't
1:01:54.750.750	1:01:58.670.670	have the money i'm just right and i said well obviously there's a lot of people in our current
1:01:58.670.670	1:02:01.550.550	society that don't have the money to start businesses in there even if it's maybe a good
1:02:01.550.550	1:02:05.470.469	idea but then you said okay well what if i do have the money i would be it would be illegal for
1:02:05.470.469	1:02:09.390.389	me to start that business to which i said well no obviously if you have the money to start that
1:02:09.390.389	1:02:12.670.670	business you might have to like hire a bunch of different companies to kind of like you know
1:02:12.670.670	1:02:17.070.070	bring those people together and you might have to go to like the cnc you know factory to you know
1:02:17.070.070	1:02:21.390.389	get the gameboy whatever and like form or something like that and you might have to go to another
1:02:21.390.389	1:02:25.070.070	company to say i want these kind of like motherboards to be made and then you know you'd have to
1:02:25.070.070	1:02:28.750.750	assemble it with some sort of technical skill yeah but if i don't have the approval from a
1:02:28.750.750	1:02:32.590.590	technocratic board how do i what you're describing is financial capital how can i do that if the board
1:02:32.590.590	1:02:37.470.469	doesn't approve me well but okay but you said you have the money so again in my system people would
1:02:37.470.469	1:02:41.950.949	still like be able to make a lot of money right hold on i'm sorry let me show let me back up i'm
1:02:41.950.949	1:02:46.990.989	so sorry okay i'm i'm being unclear my terms okay so money is is money in the bank i'm sorry when i'm
1:02:46.990.989	1:02:52.190.190	thinking capital i'm thinking of investment in like private property and in capital jet like stuff that
1:02:52.190.190	1:02:55.870.869	generates revenue or whatever my understanding is that so i asked earlier like are you allowed to
1:02:55.870.869	1:03:00.350.349	hire employees and like have a firm traditionally like that and you said no because you have to
1:03:00.350.349	1:03:05.150.150	convince the holding company to allocate you basically the the model of the business that
1:03:05.150.150	1:03:09.230.230	makes you the owner or not the owner the uh leader of some business and i'm saying okay well if i can't
1:03:09.230.230	1:03:14.590.590	convince any of those people even if i have the money i wouldn't be allowed to create my firm because
1:03:14.590.590	1:03:18.670.670	i haven't been able to convince any of those technocratic boards to allow me to create that firm
1:03:18.670.670	1:03:22.030.030	and it sounds like you're saying well you can create the firm if you have the money you just have to hire
1:03:22.030.030	1:03:26.190.190	other companies it sounds like we're just like very we're using like clever accounting ways of of
1:03:26.190.190	1:03:32.350.349	like recreating capitalism oh no so again i'm so i've i've already said pretty clearly that i don't
1:03:32.350.349	1:03:36.110.110	think because sole proprietors like they don't necessarily necessarily don't have other employees
1:03:36.110.110	1:03:40.670.670	right so it's just a matter of like who's actually doing like the final product distribution um like
1:03:40.670.670	1:03:44.670.670	in my society you'd still be able to hire someone to like cut your grass for you right i mean just like
1:03:44.670.670	1:03:49.390.389	because you know that's just like a service that you can hire for right this is that it's not this
1:03:49.390.389	1:03:52.830.829	hiring somebody to cut your grass you're not hiring an employee you're paying for a service
1:03:52.830.829	1:03:58.910.909	right if i'm trying to make retro game boys yeah i can hire the cnc factory to do the molds i can hire
1:03:58.910.909	1:04:03.470.469	the computer electronics factory to do the motherboards i can do this that and the other and then i can
1:04:03.470.469	1:04:07.790.789	assemble it and then i can go out and sell it right because you're just you're just the one person who's
1:04:07.790.789	1:04:12.350.349	making the final product and then selling it that's your value add sure you made the final assembly
1:04:12.350.349	1:04:15.710.710	okay sure i guess okay so i understand okay so i understand what you're saying so you're solving for that
1:04:15.710.710	1:04:20.190.190	problem but then if you solve for that problem by saying that if you have enough money you can go
1:04:20.190.190	1:04:23.630.630	and contract out all these other socially owned firms or whatever to do this stuff haven't you
1:04:23.630.630	1:04:27.470.469	also reintroduced the problem of don't wealthier people that have more access to creating their
1:04:27.470.469	1:04:30.910.909	dream businesses because they don't have to go to the technocratic boards and get approval they can
1:04:30.910.909	1:04:36.270.269	just do it with their own money yeah yeah my like i said my system is not perfectly egalitarian in any
1:04:36.270.269	1:04:41.310.309	means right it's just so substantially more egalitarian than we see now right so 10 of people having
1:04:41.310.309	1:04:46.750.750	25 of the wealth or or capital income or something because they're wealthy ceos is not ideal right but
1:04:46.750.750	1:04:51.470.469	i do think that you do need some kind of like pay inequality in order to incentivize um essentially
1:04:51.470.469	1:04:55.390.389	like growth and productivity and performance pay and things like that sure i understand but at the
1:04:55.390.389	1:04:59.630.630	end of the day the only way that you're solving for this even in your system that is far different
1:04:59.630.630	1:05:03.550.550	than what we currently have the only way you're solving for this is still just basically taxation
1:05:03.550.550	1:05:08.430.429	right except your taxation is coming in the form of eating all of the profits and maybe paying less
1:05:08.430.429	1:05:12.670.670	wages to people and then you're redistributing the form of welfare to people that aren't making as
1:05:12.670.670	1:05:17.630.630	much so just it feels like a really complicated way to do more tax um yeah it's definitely not just
1:05:17.630.630	1:05:22.430.429	again it's definitely not just taxes right because again like the accumulated wealth of the public
1:05:22.430.429	1:05:27.630.630	holding corporations is also horizontally distributed right so when i say horizontally distributed i'm
1:05:27.630.630	1:05:32.110.110	talking about like in an accounting sense because one person one vote we all kind of control public
1:05:32.110.110	1:05:37.150.150	wealth or whatever sure well when i say it's like well when i not in private accounts anymore well what i
1:05:37.150.150	1:05:41.790.789	say is it's basically like what you're doing is basically creating a 100 corporate tax rate
1:05:41.790.789	1:05:48.190.190	right that's really what we're doing here um well okay so well in accrued sense you could say that
1:05:48.190.190	1:05:52.110.110	but obviously these firms would have they would have retained profits and they would have reinvestment
1:05:52.110.110	1:05:56.670.670	and stuff they have reinvestment is yeah but reinvestment is not is not tax right so you're just
1:05:56.670.670	1:06:00.270.269	creating basically a 100 corporate tax rate obviously they would still do reinvestment in business and
1:06:00.270.269	1:06:04.510.510	everything you don't tax revenue tax profits um and then we're just taking that 100 corporate tax rate and
1:06:04.510.510	1:06:10.990.989	then we're redistributing in the form of other welfare payments well again again because pro because
1:06:10.990.989	1:06:15.070.070	profits can be retained in my system just like in our current system so the actual dividends would
1:06:15.070.070	1:06:19.950.949	be quote unquote taxed 100 like what you're distributing to the state is going directly to
1:06:19.950.949	1:06:23.550.550	the state obviously right whereas when you say profits are retained profits are retained where
1:06:24.830.829	1:06:29.550.550	like in the treasuries of the individual corporations but that wouldn't that just be the holding the giant
1:06:29.550.550	1:06:34.270.269	holding companies yeah the individual corporations within the holding companies portfolios or the
1:06:34.270.269	1:06:37.470.469	holding companies themselves just like yeah but those but those those holding companies
1:06:39.230.230	1:06:42.990.989	it's not really retained in the individual um companies themselves because the holding
1:06:42.990.989	1:06:46.190.190	companies could just reallocate that capital to a more profitable business if they wanted to right
1:06:46.750.750	1:06:50.830.829	and they would i would imagine we want them to do that right they could well they could have a
1:06:50.830.829	1:06:54.030.030	certain they could have like a shareholders like prioritization in that regard like what to
1:06:54.030.030	1:06:58.270.269	do with the money in the corporate treasury but again my system has very like distributed ownership
1:06:58.270.269	1:07:02.430.429	amongst these holding corporations right a holding corporation could say hey we're going to buy out
1:07:02.430.429	1:07:05.870.869	100 of apple and that's just going to be like our company like we're the we're you know we're the
1:07:05.870.869	1:07:09.550.550	holding corporation that owns apple or whatever but i think that for the most part you would see
1:07:09.550.550	1:07:13.470.469	similar to like blackrock and vanguard you would see that blackrock and vanguard don't really own a
1:07:13.470.469	1:07:18.190.190	lot of controlling stakes in any one company so they only have like this like proportional influence and
1:07:18.190.190	1:07:22.990.989	what corporations do with their uh their balance sheet you know that's the competitive process that i want to
1:07:22.990.989	1:07:28.590.590	retain retain that but then i don't understand then so you would just have like five state-owned
1:07:28.590.590	1:07:34.830.829	holding corporations and then all of them would have non-controlling shares and firms well i would
1:07:34.830.829	1:07:39.230.230	probably have like a hundred holding corporations in my ideal sense right so there'd be a lot of them
1:07:39.230.230	1:07:44.110.110	um and uh yeah again they would it would be like it would be a matter of like what do the managers of
1:07:44.110.110	1:07:48.830.829	the holding corporations think are the best investments so they might think it's good to just buy out a
1:07:48.830.829	1:07:52.110.110	company and say we own this company outright we think we can run it better than these other holding
1:07:52.110.110	1:07:56.030.030	corporations or they might just say hey look you know based on our return guidance we're just going
1:07:56.030.030	1:08:00.670.670	to go out and buy one percent of this company three percent of that company again similar to how these
1:08:00.670.670	1:08:04.990.989	asset managers allocate capital today you keep saying similar to how these asset managers allocate
1:08:04.990.989	1:08:08.830.829	but it's not at all the same way that these asset managers allocate their balance sheets would look
1:08:08.830.829	1:08:12.510.510	very i'm saying their balance sheets would look similar to that right that like you know sometimes
1:08:12.510.510	1:08:16.270.270	they buy out companies wholesale that's fine and i probably eat the same amount of calories as
1:08:16.270.270	1:08:20.350.350	like an olympic female swimmer who's like you know 4 11 but it's not even remotely the same the
1:08:20.350.350	1:08:24.030.029	way that the capital is allocated and how they're making decisions is completely and totally different
1:08:24.030.029	1:08:26.990.989	you get what i'm saying though destiny obviously no hold on i don't get what you're saying because
1:08:26.990.989	1:08:30.430.430	what you're doing is you're going to the easy part of saying like oh like let's just collect the
1:08:30.430.430	1:08:34.750.750	profits here but you're ignoring the whole process of how that capital is allocated initially how
1:08:34.750.750	1:08:38.270.270	firms are started and all the incentives along the way and we're just trying not ignoring it though
1:08:38.910.909	1:08:43.230.229	okay so i'm not ignoring it so so just to be clear right so every company today right
1:08:43.230.229	1:08:47.870.869	when you if you look up amazon stock right who owns amazon i think jeff bezos owns like 15
1:08:47.870.869	1:08:52.590.590	percent retail investors own like i don't know like 20 or 30 percent and then a bunch of different
1:08:52.590.590	1:08:58.030.029	big giant institutional investors own one two five eight seven percent of amazon that's like the
1:08:58.030.029	1:09:03.710.710	ownership structure of just amazon so in my system you would have again these these big institutional
1:09:03.710.710	1:09:10.110.109	investors displacing the same exact kind of like 70 ownership of amazon as well and they would go out and
1:09:10.110.109	1:09:14.190.189	they would say okay i think amazon's a good investment i'm going to buy their stock i'm going to hold it
1:09:14.190.189	1:09:18.110.109	i'm going to influence the board in the way that i think is valuable and then i might sell that stock
1:09:18.110.109	1:09:21.550.550	to other holding corporations or other individuals who might want to buy it on the on a sole
1:09:21.550.550	1:09:26.350.350	proprietorship side and go from there right it would be still a liquid market that you could do with
1:09:26.350.350	1:09:30.270.270	what you want with your money and allocate it entrepreneurially and you're incentivized to do
1:09:30.270.270	1:09:34.270.270	that because you would have things like performance pay and you know you'd be able to set dividend policy
1:09:34.270.270	1:09:38.670.670	and you know all right and what would you do how would you decide when to end like a holding
1:09:38.670.670	1:09:42.750.750	corporation like what if you had some holding corporations like there are different ways that i would
1:09:42.750.750	1:09:47.470.470	balance my portfolio given my stage in life right at an earlier age i can take a little bit more risk
1:09:47.470.470	1:09:52.350.350	later on i'm looking at investments that are way more um stable risk adjusted return and everything
1:09:52.350.350	1:09:55.710.710	how would i balance out like which like when do you end a holding corporation is when they run out of
1:09:55.710.710	1:10:01.790.789	money and make bad investments or yeah they would either be acquired by the other holding corporations
1:10:01.790.789	1:10:05.950.949	or they would be um they would go bankrupt you know just like regularly they would in theory they
1:10:05.950.949	1:10:10.990.989	would exist in perpetuity wait can holding corporations buy out buy shares of or buy other holding corporations
1:10:10.990.989	1:10:18.110.109	yep ideally okay can you imagine what trump would do if he wait wait no we're not even no well no
1:10:18.110.109	1:10:21.550.550	because trump wouldn't have unilateral control from the executives to be rent by a whole different
1:10:21.550.550	1:10:26.990.989	boards of people for each one but you don't think that we would be into a situation to where all of
1:10:26.990.989	1:10:32.110.109	these holding companies were just ended up like held by a couple holding companies anyway like if there
1:10:32.110.109	1:10:35.870.869	was a holding company and they made really good decisions on how they invested in stuff wouldn't i just
1:10:35.870.869	1:10:39.630.630	want like to buy some shares of just that holding company are we like recreating index funds here as well
1:10:39.630.630	1:10:45.390.390	right so similarly like right now the biggest the single largest shareholder of blackrock is vanguard
1:10:45.390.390	1:10:50.270.270	right one of its competitors um but they still hold on hold on hold on is it vanguard the the
1:10:50.270.270	1:10:55.790.789	institution owns the biggest share or is it assets under management that has bought shares of that
1:10:55.790.789	1:10:59.870.869	because those are two very very different things right well obviously yeah obviously it's assets under
1:10:59.870.869	1:11:04.910.909	management right i'm just talking about like and they're managing the assets i suppose but um it's just
1:11:04.910.909	1:11:10.190.189	about the allocated process itself um and so when it comes to sure wait wait that's those are very
1:11:10.190.189	1:11:14.270.270	very different things right because in your world these are not assets under management these are
1:11:15.150.149	1:11:20.030.029	these are state funds these are initially capitalized by the state and it's it's like the state that owns
1:11:20.030.029	1:11:24.110.109	basically the like the totality of all of these different holding companies so these aren't just
1:11:24.110.109	1:11:28.750.750	assets under management where you can just move them from from one holding company to another right so
1:11:28.750.750	1:11:31.870.869	that i'm just saying it's a meaningfully different thing because you keep saying like oh well blackrock
1:11:31.870.869	1:11:36.510.510	going to all this well no those are investors that invest in blackrock and in in vanguard and then
1:11:36.510.510	1:11:39.710.710	they allocate their money that way and those assets are managed by blackrock and they're managed by
1:11:39.710.710	1:11:42.910.909	vanguard but they're not vanguard or blackrock funds themselves i think that's meaningfully different
1:11:42.910.909	1:11:46.910.909	right so obviously it's meaningfully different in the sense that again it's not individual accounts
1:11:46.910.909	1:11:51.150.149	right so the the account here would be the public um it wouldn't be like individual accounts like
1:11:51.150.149	1:11:56.030.029	you're describing but i think that in terms of just that allocative process like okay can we imagine at
1:11:56.030.029	1:12:01.070.069	least that this allocated process these assets under management are being allocated by vanguard
1:12:01.070.069	1:12:06.510.510	either passively or actively can we recreate that process under a public ownership uh ideal i think
1:12:06.510.510	1:12:11.950.949	certainly that we could with these public holding corporations um and so um i i can't remember the
1:12:11.950.949	1:12:15.870.869	originally we got kind of sidetracked i can't remember what your original question was um just if
1:12:15.870.869	1:12:19.390.390	i think companies can buy other holding corporations feel like we're it just feels like we're creating like
1:12:19.390.390	1:12:23.630.630	index funds and we're creating everything else yeah yeah yeah so you said um wouldn't the wouldn't
1:12:23.630.630	1:12:27.550.550	one you know wouldn't eventually you have some concentration or anything like that right and and so my
1:12:27.550.550	1:12:32.590.590	answer is certainly yes you know you would have concentration you know markets naturally concentrate
1:12:32.590.590	1:12:36.590.590	kind of ownership and and power to some degree right because you know in theory one company is
1:12:36.590.590	1:12:39.870.869	better than the other ones and people only shop there or whatever so you'd still have this kind
1:12:39.870.869	1:12:44.590.590	of concentration of ownership probably over time but you know that's why i mean my system you you
1:12:44.590.590	1:12:49.710.710	still have to have fiscal actors you still have to have things like antitrust um so my system would
1:12:49.710.710	1:12:53.310.310	would ideally and you see this all across the world you know the best systems will have public owned
1:12:53.310.310	1:12:57.710.710	assets but then they also have adversarial regulators that will try to you know ensure that they're
1:12:57.710.710	1:13:02.350.350	you know playing by the rules being transparent being audited um and so my system would uh would have the
1:13:02.350.350	1:13:13.950.949	same thing okay and then um i'm just curious well okay yeah and so i i guess destiny would you say that
1:13:13.950.949	1:13:20.270.270	you're skeptical of my model you know just essentially because we just we just can't we can't see an example
1:13:20.270.270	1:13:24.350.350	of it working right because obviously you would agree that you know to the extent that my model is
1:13:24.350.350	1:13:28.510.510	a transitionary state it sounds like you might agree like yeah i mean the transition might be great
1:13:28.510.510	1:13:32.910.909	to have something you said oh having like a public kind of stock company or something would be great
1:13:32.910.909	1:13:35.950.949	you just don't believe in a hundred percent ownership maybe it only maybe it has to be
1:13:36.830.829	1:13:40.350.350	sixty percent or something like that you just can't it's hard to imagine going the full hundred
1:13:41.630.630	1:13:45.630.630	i mean there's questions in getting to to the full hundred but the real problem is that
1:13:45.630.630	1:13:49.790.789	when people talk about public ownership i don't think that people are ever talking about
1:13:49.790.789	1:13:54.990.989	public ownership they just they're talking about public profits which are which are taxes um
1:13:54.990.989	1:14:00.670.670	and the hard part about public ownership isn't in the getting profit that's easy it's the making
1:14:00.670.670	1:14:05.150.149	decisions so when we talk about the industry in like 60 90 or whatever that's not really the hard part
1:14:05.150.149	1:14:08.670.670	the hard part is the difference between like one percent like 51 or like controlling shares in
1:14:08.670.670	1:14:13.390.390	companies because that's where all of the hard parts of capitalism in an ideal world are working
1:14:13.390.390	1:14:17.630.630	well in our current world work the best is when people decide where to allocate their money towards
1:14:17.630.630	1:14:22.990.989	um but if you're not being punished by profit incentive then we have to look to other ways to
1:14:22.990.989	1:14:27.950.949	guide investment and it sounds like right now in your system that way would be debating i guess like
1:14:27.950.949	1:14:31.550.550	a board of technocrats to convince them that your business idea is a good idea and you hope that you
1:14:31.550.550	1:14:36.670.670	can convince them well yeah i mean my my system would you would be punished by the profit incentive
1:14:36.670.670	1:14:41.390.390	as well right so again business kids can still start and fail and my system um i guess in some
1:14:41.390.390	1:14:44.670.670	sense you could say that there's like extra steps to starting a business in my system this
1:14:44.670.670	1:14:48.510.510	doesn't look quite the same which i fully concede well what's the penalty for like a holding company
1:14:48.510.510	1:14:53.150.149	failing like what happens they would go bankrupt and everyone that works there would lose their jobs
1:14:54.430.430	1:15:00.830.829	but they would still i mean they'd be fine right why would they be fine they'd be unemployed
1:15:01.550.550	1:15:04.670.670	because in your system you have massive horizontalization of all of the profits that are
1:15:04.670.670	1:15:07.070.069	being controlled by all of the other holding corporations so there's not like any real
1:15:07.070.069	1:15:11.710.710	detriment at the end of the day well they would still they would still qualify for welfare benefits
1:15:11.710.710	1:15:16.270.270	obviously right but i mean people you know welfare benefits only replace such a high percentage of
1:15:16.270.270	1:15:20.110.109	your income of course right i mean capital income is only like thirty percent of income so you know
1:15:20.110.109	1:15:25.790.789	you'd still be pretty if you got laid off from your job right so you know it would you'd still be
1:15:25.790.789	1:15:30.110.109	incentivized to do a good job and not get fired and yeah i guess but you could take so you i just feel
1:15:30.110.109	1:15:34.270.270	like you there could be so much more theoretical risk such that if they go bankrupt all the time it might
1:15:34.270.270	1:15:38.030.029	be worth it right because at the end of the day in your system you'd be guaranteed at least
1:15:38.030.029	1:15:45.070.069	i'm guessing like a house a tv a car the ability to have one month paid vacation you know phone with
1:15:45.070.069	1:15:48.430.430	internet like all these things so if i was like the technocrat managing this holding court i'd
1:15:48.430.430	1:15:54.030.029	probably be looking for insanely risky investments because why not right well again so i really don't
1:15:54.030.029	1:15:58.190.189	think so just because you know we see like for instance we see like capital accumulation like
1:15:58.190.189	1:16:02.030.029	capital investment in many other countries that have you know much more generous welfare benefits than
1:16:02.030.029	1:16:06.830.829	we do here um and you know there's a lot of papers about um there's there's a lot of papers about
1:16:06.830.829	1:16:11.630.630	this that'll say that you know in in many different ways just having generous welfare benefits is
1:16:11.630.630	1:16:16.270.270	actually very very good for economic growth because like literally kids will grow up with bigger brains
1:16:16.270.270	1:16:20.670.670	and you know people i don't deny that but in all of those states that you're talking about the capital
1:16:20.670.670	1:16:25.870.869	owners are getting all of the benefit from the capital accrual but in your system you've eliminated
1:16:25.870.869	1:16:32.030.029	that benefit so i'm i don't know what the well again so welfare capital income is only again about
1:16:32.030.029	1:16:36.830.829	20 or it's about 25 to 30 percent of income right wait what do you mean when you say that 25 to 30
1:16:36.830.829	1:16:42.350.350	of income what does that mean all the income payments that are paid out about 30 of it is capital
1:16:42.350.350	1:16:47.870.869	income right so labor still makes you know the vast majority of income like total income that's paid
1:16:47.870.869	1:16:50.990.989	out is paid to labor not capital owners wait but that doesn't make any sense because if you're
1:16:50.990.989	1:16:54.350.350	trying to solve for wealth inequality you're not talking about just capital payouts you're talking
1:16:54.350.350	1:16:58.830.829	about capital accrual right you're talking about like increases in wealth right so you have to find a
1:16:58.830.829	1:17:04.270.270	way to redistribute that as well no well so the the wealth the the wealth at the end of the day so
1:17:04.270.270	1:17:08.350.350	like for instance if a holding corporation goes bankrupt right um those assets would go under a
1:17:08.350.350	1:17:12.590.590	managed bankruptcy they would be bought out by other investors in this case it'd be other holding
1:17:12.590.590	1:17:17.390.390	corporations um well no i understand but when you say you keep saying you say 30 of stuff is paid out by
1:17:18.030.029	1:17:22.110.109	capital like when you say that you understand that the vast majority of the wealth that's being
1:17:22.110.109	1:17:26.110.109	created in this country goes to rich people not because they're getting dividends but because the
1:17:26.110.109	1:17:30.750.750	capital is increasing in in value right like jeff bezos isn't worth what he's worth because
1:17:30.750.750	1:17:34.590.590	the amazon stock he has is paying him sick dividends he's worth that much because the amazon's the
1:17:34.590.590	1:17:38.750.750	business itself has grown to that value right so what's so maybe i'm misunderstanding your point so
1:17:38.750.750	1:17:44.430.430	what is your point about people would be incentivized to take infinite risk because now the capital's
1:17:44.430.430	1:17:48.910.909	publicly owned but i think they still engage in substantial you know they still are substantially
1:17:48.910.909	1:17:54.750.750	punished by risk uh for risk uh if they you know up and don't get their performance pay or get fired or
1:17:54.750.750	1:17:58.510.510	their whole company goes bankrupt right yeah i guess i'm trying to figure out like in terms of the
1:17:58.510.510	1:18:03.230.229	holding corporations like if we're saying that they're if if we're saying that there is like a
1:18:03.230.229	1:18:07.950.949	decent upside if you pick better than anybody else right because now the public funds
1:18:10.110.109	1:18:14.190.189	or wait hold on when you're capitalizing these initial holding corporations do they just get like
1:18:14.190.189	1:18:17.870.869	the starting money and then they don't get any more money or how do they get more money or do they
1:18:17.870.869	1:18:23.390.390	ever get more money so hard budget constraint so they would get the initial capitalization and then any money
1:18:23.390.390	1:18:27.630.630	from there they would need to raise capital from other entities or they would need to uh do balance
1:18:27.630.630	1:18:32.750.750	sheet financing maybe what does raise capital from other entities man who would they raise capital out
1:18:33.870.869	1:18:39.230.229	well from from the competing set of other uh you know banks that would offer capital to them they'd have
1:18:39.230.229	1:18:44.030.029	to get loans they would have to go out and use their balance sheet or they'd have to uh maybe they
1:18:44.030.029	1:18:49.390.390	would go to other holding corporations and engage in joint ventures um things like that i feel like
1:18:49.390.390	1:18:54.510.510	we've i feel like we're just hardcore recreating capitalism with way more paperwork so again we're
1:18:54.510.510	1:19:00.910.909	so again we're recreating the competitive dynamics of our system the competitive ownership is privately
1:19:00.910.909	1:19:06.110.109	owned yeah but the competitive dynamics only work because you're competing for the payout at the end
1:19:06.110.109	1:19:12.510.510	right to some extent well um i mean i think that a lot when you look at a lot of these corporations
1:19:12.510.510	1:19:16.110.109	right so i mean a lot of these corporations do have like share-based compensation and things like
1:19:16.110.109	1:19:21.310.310	that but you know i think a lot of the investment that we see here when you say that wait a lot of
1:19:21.310.310	1:19:25.870.869	these corporations have share-based compensation the most successful corporations in our country right
1:19:25.870.869	1:19:31.950.949	now are owned by disproportionately insanely wealthy people right yeah sure so what is that i don't
1:19:31.950.949	1:19:35.550.550	understand what that was supposed to solve to have share-based because i feel like what you're saying
1:19:35.550.550	1:19:40.350.350	what you're saying is the thing about capitalism the reason why we've been able to accumulate such wealth
1:19:40.350.350	1:19:45.070.069	is because of this disproportionate ownership like you're incentivized to basically engage in
1:19:45.070.069	1:19:50.830.829	entrepreneurial activity because you have the incentive of you know being worth a lot of money
1:19:50.830.829	1:19:56.750.750	you know you have the ownership of the things that you're doing now what i would say is that that isn't
1:19:56.750.750	1:20:01.470.470	quite right i think that the main reason why people go out and do well there's a lot of different
1:20:01.470.470	1:20:05.310.310	reasons i guess your theory of entrepreneurship a lot of people number one just like to do it a lot
1:20:05.310.310	1:20:09.870.869	of people um are perfectly fine like innovating but not being owners like a lot of the innovations
1:20:09.870.869	1:20:14.750.750	within corporations come from workers and not necessarily owners but to the extent that those those like uh
1:20:14.750.750	1:20:19.630.630	you know the sort of great man theory of capitalism that you have like these great people who come up
1:20:19.630.630	1:20:24.270.270	because of this uh huge incentive to accumulate wealth again when we talk about i'll make two points
1:20:24.270.270	1:20:27.630.630	and then i'll throw it over to you when we talk about a lot of these people and how they actually
1:20:27.630.630	1:20:32.110.109	started their businesses right they started with a very little amount of capital investment and then
1:20:32.110.109	1:20:36.030.029	they just you know essentially like over uh what do you call it uh it accumulated from there
1:20:36.030.029	1:20:40.430.430	right so the initial capital investment was quite small so you can kind of min max there and then on
1:20:40.430.430	1:20:44.510.510	the other hand it's like okay well what actually incentivizes people to do productive activity
1:20:44.510.510	1:20:48.350.350	i think it's more so just their compensation right it's just like okay are we providing performance
1:20:48.350.350	1:20:52.030.029	based compensation i don't think that that performance based compensation necessarily has
1:20:52.030.029	1:20:56.590.590	to be in the form of shares right it could just be in the form of just cash bonuses that we give to
1:20:56.590.590	1:21:01.070.069	people i don't disagree for like employees but i feel like owners or entrepreneurs i think
1:21:01.070.069	1:21:04.750.750	approach it a little bit differently they're not just looking for like high compensation or high
1:21:05.390.390	1:21:09.310.310	payout necessarily i think they're looking for like ownership of the business or the entity that
1:21:09.310.310	1:21:14.430.430	they're creating i think that's a really important part of that um yeah i mean we're operating on
1:21:14.430.430	1:21:18.030.029	conjecture i don't think it's actually that important i think that when you when you when you
1:21:18.030.029	1:21:22.430.430	it seems to me that when i talk to really type a entrepreneurs in the world you know they would
1:21:22.430.430	1:21:26.750.750	tell you look i just love what i do and i don't give a and i just like doing this kind of work or
1:21:26.750.750	1:21:30.830.829	whatever um and i think that when you look at a lot of the innovations that get made a lot of it's
1:21:30.830.829	1:21:34.910.909	from public investment from individual workers at companies you know like scientists that do a lot of
1:21:34.910.909	1:21:38.190.189	you know research aren't they're not like wealthy business owners they're just technically
1:21:38.190.189	1:21:42.190.189	trained people that love to do what they do now again i'm not saying like love to do what they do
1:21:42.190.189	1:21:46.430.430	is like that's like a certain employees or like career no exactly but like that's what i was gonna
1:21:46.430.430	1:21:50.190.189	say though yeah that's what i was gonna say the last thing i was gonna say is that you know my sense
1:21:50.190.189	1:21:55.470.470	is that look we do have to incentivize people to engage in like high value added activity right
1:21:55.470.470	1:21:59.950.949	but i don't think that we necessarily need to incentivize that activity by having you know a
1:21:59.950.949	1:22:04.030.029	bunch of billionaires in society i think that rather we can just have a bunch of ceos that are paid
1:22:04.030.029	1:22:08.030.029	you know in the millions of dollars but they're not necessarily accumulating like billions of dollars
1:22:08.190.189	1:22:13.790.789	capital to do what they do i think that that's to me lines up more so with my understanding of how
1:22:13.790.789	1:22:20.750.750	innovation and productivity enhancements actually happen um okay but i was i was gonna yeah i was
1:22:20.750.750	1:22:25.550.550	gonna ask you destiny though because again what what's your ideal system right because it sounds like
1:22:25.550.550	1:22:31.710.710	when we've spoken before that your ideal system it looks it seems to look very similar to the nordic
1:22:31.710.710	1:22:37.310.310	model that's why i said like hey if we can like if we can agree that okay we should get to a world where
1:22:37.310.310	1:22:44.030.029	the gdp is 40 45 from socially owned entities instead of you know 20 or 30 like it is today
1:22:44.030.029	1:22:48.430.430	like that's still a huge amount of socialization in the economy like if but i don't know if you
1:22:48.430.430	1:22:51.390.390	actually endorse the nordic model like what does your ideal system look like in terms of wealth
1:22:51.390.390	1:22:57.790.789	distribution and also i don't know i don't know if the nordic model is 45 social ownership um but the
1:22:57.790.789	1:23:03.550.550	i mean like i my one my ideal a psychological one which will never happen is that if people just didn't
1:23:03.550.550	1:23:07.150.149	care about wealth inequality so much um i feel like there are real psychological things that you
1:23:07.150.149	1:23:10.750.750	have to actually deal with i think you do have to care about it unfortunately um but the second thing
1:23:10.750.750	1:23:14.590.590	is that i just tend to advocate for way more redistribution because i don't think that
1:23:14.590.590	1:23:18.750.750	redistribution is as much a deterrent to business owners as anything else i do think ownership of the
1:23:18.750.750	1:23:22.510.510	business is important but i think if you were to talk to a business owner like you're saying that
1:23:22.510.510	1:23:27.150.149	oh no they just have a passion for what they do but i think part of what they do is they own a thing
1:23:27.150.149	1:23:30.910.909	and that's like a thing that feels cool and good to them is because it's their business so i think that
1:23:30.910.909	1:23:34.350.350	as long as they still have their business if you tax them even five or ten percentage points more
1:23:34.350.350	1:23:38.190.189	i don't think people like oh i don't want to have this business anymore um but if you just say oh
1:23:38.190.189	1:23:42.750.750	no like this is just going to be owned by the state or you don't get to have like controlling decisions
1:23:42.750.750	1:23:48.190.189	about it i do think that would heavily discourage people from um having businesses because well now
1:23:48.190.189	1:23:53.150.149	it feels like it's not even my thing anymore um yeah so i mean basically just more like more
1:23:53.150.149	1:23:59.310.310	redistribution i think that like yeah yeah yeah yeah so i think i i guess i just disagree i think that
1:23:59.310.310	1:24:04.750.750	there's a lot of evidence that taxes and especially the kinds of taxes that politicians are likely to
1:24:04.750.750	1:24:09.790.789	favor are very bad for the economy right um like for instance even in the nordic economies which i do
1:24:09.790.789	1:24:15.710.710	uphold they have really inefficient tax systems which many many papers would show you are pretty bad for
1:24:15.710.710	1:24:20.030.029	their economy at large but obviously they're not like so bad that it destroys the economy they're just
1:24:20.030.029	1:24:24.190.189	like marginally worse i mean i agree with you but i think there are some taxes that are really good
1:24:24.190.189	1:24:29.230.229	they're just politically unpopular like i think that um i think most economists like property taxes
1:24:29.230.229	1:24:33.710.710	i think are good and i think that um income taxes i think are good progressive income taxes i think
1:24:33.710.710	1:24:37.310.310	these are both very good taxes but they're like the least popular ones politically and everybody hates
1:24:37.310.310	1:24:41.070.069	them but i think that like some of the worst taxes that people talk about are things like financial
1:24:41.070.069	1:24:43.630.630	transaction taxes which we're not really talking about here i guess because we don't have like
1:24:43.630.630	1:24:47.790.789	stock markets as much anymore in your system but then the other hated tax is the corporate tax and
1:24:47.790.789	1:24:52.190.189	your system is essentially like a 100 corporate tax rate system and i feel like it's one of the most
1:24:52.190.189	1:24:56.990.989	inefficient ones that most economists think is a bad tax so that's but that's why i made it very clear
1:24:56.990.989	1:25:01.870.869	right so there is a huge difference between a 100 corporate tax and owning a hundred percent of a
1:25:01.870.869	1:25:07.310.310	business right so for instance i don't think that it makes the business um like i don't think that we
1:25:07.310.310	1:25:12.590.590	would have to make the argument that the shareholder structure of amazon makes amazon less productive
1:25:12.590.590	1:25:16.190.189	because they send out i'm just i don't know if amazon pays a dividend but whatever they pay a dividend
1:25:16.190.189	1:25:21.390.390	out or they pay return capital to their shareholders right that's a totally different thing than
1:25:21.390.390	1:25:26.750.750	does the tax from the state cause negative things to happen to the operations of that business
1:25:26.750.750	1:25:31.630.630	there's a lot of papers that show that corporate taxes are bad for business accumulation and
1:25:31.630.630	1:25:35.790.789	business formation but there's not a lot of papers that say that basically just paying out dividends
1:25:35.790.789	1:25:39.790.789	are bad because it's that's your incentive you're incentivized to do that as a corporation well the
1:25:39.790.789	1:25:43.470.470	dividends have nothing to your shareholders yeah but you can return capital a ton of ways i don't
1:25:43.470.470	1:25:46.910.909	think there's much difference between dividends versus just the value of the stock increasing for
1:25:46.910.909	1:25:51.790.789	instance um yeah but you're but you're making an efficiency argument and describing my system as
1:25:51.790.789	1:25:55.310.310	a hundred percent corporate tax when that's really not it my system doesn't take all the corporate
1:25:55.310.310	1:26:00.350.350	profits and you know mandatorily extract it away from the business my system has a system where
1:26:01.230.229	1:26:06.190.189	the owners of the business profits are for the owners of the business right right well the owner
1:26:06.190.189	1:26:10.750.750	again in my system the owners wouldn't just literally like scrape off like all the profits from
1:26:10.750.750	1:26:15.310.310	the business there would be a dividend policy decided by the board that was on balance what we
1:26:15.310.310	1:26:19.870.869	could return to shareholders with the actual long-term interests of this corporation similar to what we
1:26:19.870.869	1:26:24.430.430	see now i hate saying that because you seem to not like when i wait i don't hold on wait wait i'm
1:26:24.430.430	1:26:29.150.149	just you're the business i don't know why you can't own i'll buy bullets my system you have to bite the
1:26:29.150.149	1:26:33.390.390	bullet on this there are no profits in your system for the business those all are gone those all go to
1:26:33.390.390	1:26:37.390.390	the state to the holding companies to be distributed no why would they why would they be gone i don't
1:26:37.390.390	1:26:41.790.789	understand because if they're because of profits because if profits still exist in some manner to be
1:26:41.790.789	1:26:46.270.270	redistributed to people working at that business you've just recreated all of capitalism because now when
1:26:46.270.270	1:26:49.150.149	these holding companies are looking to invest in businesses employees are only going to work for
1:26:49.150.149	1:26:52.270.270	businesses that have like profitable distribution structures and then holding
1:26:52.270.270	1:26:54.910.909	corporates are going to invest in businesses that have more profits and you just recreate
1:26:54.910.909	1:26:59.550.550	i want but then you just recreated capitalism and all the wealth inequality market market
1:26:59.550.550	1:27:04.910.909	competition is not capitalism capitalism is when production is privately owned in my system
1:27:04.910.909	1:27:09.150.149	production is publicly owned but you still have market competition so obviously a business
1:27:09.150.149	1:27:12.670.670	like i we said no no wait wait wait hold on wait this doesn't make sense it can't be
1:27:12.670.670	1:27:17.630.630	publicly owned if the privates i'm sorry the privates if the profits are private
1:27:19.230.229	1:27:22.830.829	no the pro so the process can't be private publicly owned system
1:27:23.710.710	1:27:29.310.310	no no the pro so it's not about the profits but the profits are not privately owned in the sense that
1:27:29.310.310	1:27:35.230.229	the people who are deciding what to do with the profits are individual investors right i'm advocating
1:27:35.230.229	1:27:39.870.869	for you said the hard part is the decision-making process so i'm being very what i think to be in
1:27:39.870.869	1:27:44.510.510	depth about the decision-making process the decision-making process would be technocratic
1:27:44.510.510	1:27:49.230.229	and it would be very similar to what we see if i work for a company and there's ability no no it's
1:27:49.230.229	1:27:52.030.029	because you keep saying it would be technocratic that's not saying anything i'm asking let's say
1:27:52.030.029	1:27:55.550.550	that i work for a firm i didn't finish what i was saying i know but you're just saying generals okay
1:27:55.550.550	1:27:59.630.630	i work for a firm and it's got a trillion dollars in profits what does that trillion dollars in profits go
1:27:59.630.630	1:28:07.390.390	so the board of that similar to today's sake the board of that company would make a decision on how
1:28:07.390.390	1:28:12.270.270	much profits do we need to retain what do we want to use those profits for how much profits based on
1:28:12.270.270	1:28:18.510.510	our dividend guidance can we actually send to the owners that's how amazon works apple works tesla
1:28:18.510.510	1:28:23.790.789	works they all do that they they have a general dividend guidance where they want to send a certain
1:28:23.790.789	1:28:27.550.550	amount of capital their shareholders but then they obviously keep a lot of their profits for things
1:28:27.550.550	1:28:32.350.350	like reinvestment for things like paying down debt and yeah for things like employee compensation
1:28:32.350.350	1:28:36.670.670	but that's not like a radical departure from what we see now so hold on no no that's a radical departure
1:28:36.670.670	1:28:41.230.229	because the capital profits so profits are not ever for employee compensation right profits are
1:28:41.230.229	1:28:44.750.750	the excess that you have after everything else including cost of labor profits are the things
1:28:44.750.750	1:28:50.350.350	you have that you return to the shareholders right but in your world i i you're i can't tell who
1:28:50.350.350	1:28:54.430.430	the shareholders are so the shareholders should just be in our system in our system we do not
1:28:54.430.430	1:28:59.070.069	return 100 of the profits to the owners of the company now you're right to say that that's what
1:28:59.070.069	1:29:04.430.430	you're supposed to do what do you mean oh you're you're absolutely desi okay do you think when amazon
1:29:04.430.430	1:29:09.470.470	makes a billion dollars in profits shareholders get a billion dollar check uh if there's nothing else to
1:29:09.470.470	1:29:15.070.069	invest the money in yes right exactly if there's no they have to make the decision if there's nothing
1:29:15.070.069	1:29:18.910.909	else to invest the money in if we've paid out all of the that we need to pay out if we don't want to
1:29:18.910.909	1:29:24.910.909	pay down our debt then we send the rest to the shareholders but that's not the same thing as a 100
1:29:24.910.909	1:29:30.510.510	shareholder tax and my system's not 100 corporate tax because businesses would have to say hey we've
1:29:30.510.510	1:29:34.350.350	paid all of our employees we don't have anything else that we want to invest in we have this money
1:29:34.350.350	1:29:37.870.869	that's left over we have this dividend guidance that's how much money we're going to send to our
1:29:37.870.869	1:29:44.270.270	shareholders which happens to be the public in my which is all the profits no it's not it's not all
1:29:44.270.270	1:29:48.990.989	the profits are retained and used for other investing activities yeah that's reinvested
1:29:48.990.989	1:29:53.230.229	that's like sure but that's like reinvested stuff is not the excess money that you make at the end
1:29:53.230.229	1:29:59.310.310	of everything else right like and if you are taxed in a corporate tax is not money after basically every
1:29:59.310.310	1:30:04.110.109	single investment you make it's just the accounting profit of the business right obviously with a lot
1:30:04.110.109	1:30:09.310.310	of complications but you get what i'm saying like corporate taxes tax a much broader set of money
1:30:09.310.310	1:30:13.950.949	than just money that's finally available to shareholders isn't in a general sense isn't that
1:30:13.950.949	1:30:18.590.590	generally what corporate taxes are aimed at like you don't generally tax like revenues right it sounds
1:30:18.590.590	1:30:23.470.470	like you're talking about revenues and i'm talking about profits no no but again you you tax pro you
1:30:23.470.470	1:30:28.190.189	do tax corporate profits right but there's a difference between corporate profits and essentially retained
1:30:28.190.189	1:30:32.190.189	earnings which are used to pay out dividends right retained earnings are not the same thing
1:30:32.190.189	1:30:38.430.430	wait why you keep saying dividends dividends are profits no no okay i use the technical term
1:30:38.430.430	1:30:43.070.069	retained earnings which are that's the money that's used to pay out dividends and to return capital
1:30:43.070.069	1:30:47.710.710	to shareholders that's not the same thing as the profits that are taxable from a corporate profit
1:30:47.710.710	1:30:52.030.029	perspective wait so you're saying hold on so you're saying that the dividends that a company pays
1:30:52.030.029	1:31:00.590.590	out corporate taxes don't apply at all to that um so yeah so if i own a business and i say i'm not i'm
1:31:00.590.590	1:31:04.670.670	never going to withdraw anything i'm just going to pay myself a 100 dividend from all the extra money
1:31:04.670.670	1:31:10.750.750	i don't have to pay corporate taxes yeah a corporate yes so it applies to both labor and capital
1:31:10.750.750	1:31:15.230.229	so the corporate tax because it taxes a broader base than essentially just distributions to capital
1:31:15.230.229	1:31:19.710.710	when you actually study the incidence of corporate taxation it falls to both labor and capital no no
1:31:19.710.710	1:31:24.110.109	no hold on a second when you talk about incidents of taxation you say it falls to labor it falls to
1:31:24.110.109	1:31:28.670.670	labor such that the company might choose to pay them less but not because it's a direct tax on the
1:31:28.670.670	1:31:33.790.789	labor itself it only falls to labor in the same way that tariffs in probably are about 50 50 between
1:31:33.790.789	1:31:38.190.189	the consumer and the producer but not because the producer china is actually paying the tariffs but because
1:31:38.190.189	1:31:40.830.829	they're going to have to drop the price a little bit in order to remain competitive in the market and
1:31:40.830.829	1:31:43.870.869	it's like about 50 50 the end of the day but that doesn't mean they're paying the tariff so the same
1:31:43.870.869	1:31:47.950.949	way they're going to pay corporate taxes sure so just think about it conceptually right so if the
1:31:47.950.949	1:31:52.510.510	business has a certain amount of profits that it wants to use for investment right because we're
1:31:52.510.510	1:31:56.910.909	taxing corporate profits and not retained earnings then the amount of money that the corporation
1:31:56.910.909	1:32:01.870.869	has for investment goes down wait so let's say the corporation has a billion dollars in
1:32:01.870.869	1:32:06.430.430	profits and then it wants to reinvest that billion dollars in profits into more capital are you saying that
1:32:06.430.430	1:32:12.990.989	that billion dollars in profits is facing a corporate tax rate in our current system so i'm
1:32:12.990.989	1:32:18.510.510	sorry say it again i didn't understand if i reinvest all my profit into my business am i paying taxes on
1:32:18.510.510	1:32:24.350.350	the profit that i reinvest into my business so that yeah that's one of the problems with our current tax
1:32:24.350.350	1:32:28.590.590	is that we we don't we don't exempt investment activities completely right we have things like
1:32:28.590.590	1:32:33.470.470	depreciation where you're actually end up being overtaxed on what you're actually investing in right
1:32:33.470.470	1:32:37.230.229	that was one of the things now we're nibbling we're super nibbling around the edges at this
1:32:37.230.229	1:32:40.750.750	point i understand that there are certain classes of reinvestment that might not have the the best
1:32:40.750.750	1:32:44.110.109	tax treatment in a corporate taxes but i'm saying that if i have a business and i have a billion
1:32:44.110.109	1:32:47.710.710	dollars in profits i'm like okay i'm gonna buy a whole new fleet of vans i'm gonna buy a whole new
1:32:47.710.710	1:32:53.230.229	uh facility or whatever um generally speaking this this money would generally be tax exempt there might be
1:32:53.230.229	1:32:59.630.630	some particular cases around not generally generally that's not the case depreciation okay if you buy a
1:32:59.630.630	1:33:04.430.430	fact you know i mean if you buy a factory and it costs 100 million dollars there's all these complex
1:33:04.430.430	1:33:09.550.550	rules for how to depreciate that asset and actually claim the tax write-off correct so if you spend 100
1:33:09.550.550	1:33:13.710.710	million dollars in profit or in like you have 100 million dollars in profits and you decide i'm gonna
1:33:13.710.710	1:33:19.230.229	buy a you know a factory with this money right the government is still going to extract some of that
1:33:19.230.229	1:33:23.870.869	money from you so you're either not able to build the full amount of your factory or you have to have
1:33:23.870.869	1:33:28.590.590	more money to build the full factory because you're only able to claim like say 10 of the value of
1:33:28.590.590	1:33:33.550.550	that factory as a tax deduction on an annual basis so all i'm saying and you know retained earnings
1:33:33.550.550	1:33:36.990.989	which is the my understanding is the money that's actually used to pay out dividends and return
1:33:36.990.989	1:33:42.670.670	capital to shareholders that is a smaller pot of money after you're actually already have paid your
1:33:42.670.670	1:33:46.510.510	corporate tax money um it's just it's i'm just the only reason we got off on this is because you
1:33:46.510.510	1:33:52.590.590	described my system as similarly inefficient or similar to paying 100 corporate tax but it's not my
1:33:52.590.590	1:33:56.510.510	system is to a pretty radical degree much more efficient like if you had 100 corporate tax rate
1:33:56.510.510	1:34:01.470.470	the economy would essentially be destroyed but i guess yeah i guess do that so i can't tell you
1:34:01.470.470	1:34:05.710.710	every single thing about every depreciation schedule i do know that in general depreciating things over
1:34:05.710.710	1:34:09.950.949	time is more beneficial than depreciating it all up front right that if i had 100 million dollars of
1:34:09.950.949	1:34:14.270.270	income or revenues this year next year the year after i would want to depreciate on a time scale
1:34:14.270.270	1:34:18.430.430	instead of depreciating all up front because in terms of like tax brackets and everything else
1:34:18.430.430	1:34:22.590.590	um like generally speaking is better well actually wait i don't i don't know if there are different
1:34:22.590.590	1:34:26.110.109	corporate tax brackets but but generally like spreading this out over time is helpful i know there are some
1:34:26.110.109	1:34:30.190.189	things that you can do full depreciation up front as opposed to doing it over time uh but i don't
1:34:30.190.189	1:34:33.470.470	i don't know i don't know the individual depreciation schedule every single thing that's my that's my
1:34:33.470.470	1:34:37.550.550	offense right that's my offense is that i think that your system you're saying basically look i would
1:34:37.550.550	1:34:41.470.470	just tax more and redistribute more i don't necessarily care about like these like the public
1:34:41.470.470	1:34:45.230.229	wealth accumulation i guess you did endorse the sovereign wealth fund but it's not clear like how big the
1:34:45.230.229	1:34:48.270.270	sovereign wealth fund well sure but i also don't think again sovereign wealth fund that's just a big
1:34:48.270.270	1:34:52.510.510	retirement account is they're not making decisions about things that's what i that's the
1:34:52.510.510	1:34:56.750.750	well they're they're still collective they're still collectivizing like the means of production
1:34:56.750.750	1:35:00.190.189	because obviously they're buying a lot of equities with that money right so it's just a matter of how
1:35:00.190.189	1:35:04.750.750	big the sovereign wealth fund would be um so that's why i'm saying your system is kind of like a down
1:35:04.750.750	1:35:09.870.869	payment in some sense on my system but i think that your system by ultimately requiring a higher tax
1:35:09.870.869	1:35:13.230.229	burden on society because society isn't just getting the direct dividend payments from all these
1:35:13.230.229	1:35:18.670.670	corporations is marginally less efficient because we have a lot of evidence we have a lot of evidence
1:35:18.670.670	1:35:23.470.470	that you know taxes like that are just you know they're not really good for your economy sure i
1:35:23.470.470	1:35:28.190.189	mean i mean they i mean ideally i guess ideally everybody would make enough money to not need any
1:35:28.190.189	1:35:32.830.829	wealth redistribution at all i just i don't understand what is the um okay wait okay i have one
1:35:32.830.829	1:35:36.830.829	question but before we get i'm just trying to go back so if there is a company and this company is a
1:35:36.830.829	1:35:42.990.989	highly profitable company compared to another company that's not as profitable are the employees and the
1:35:42.990.989	1:35:48.430.430	highly profitable company just getting a whole bunch of extra money or are the other employees
1:35:48.430.430	1:35:52.750.750	or is all that money going to the holding company and then it's just reinvesting in other companies
1:35:52.750.750	1:35:58.670.670	that it's holding it has holdings i would i would expect my system would have a similar um pay
1:35:58.670.670	1:36:03.390.390	structure to today where larger more profitable businesses tended to pay more that probably would
1:36:03.390.390	1:36:11.760.760	happen yeah okay um and then and then the profits of any of those so the extra money they make
1:36:11.760.760	1:36.000	after paying out everything are those profits going to the holding company to invest in other companies
1:36.000	1:36:24.880.880	or is it just sitting in the bank account for potential future investment um i'm sorry so is
1:36:24.880.880	1:36:28.640.640	the is the is the money that there is the money in the treasury what's what are they doing with
1:36:28.640.640	1:36:34.240.239	the money that they keep in their treasuries yeah well they would so it would yeah so they would do
1:36:34.240.239	1:36.000	um whatever they think would be most productive with it right so they could accumulate that money
1:36.000	1:36:42.160.159	for a future investment that they want to make they could make current investments um they could you
1:36:42.160.159	1:36:46.640.640	know redo their compensation structure if it's uncompetitive they could pay down their debt they could
1:36:46.640.640	1:36:50.320.319	obviously start completely well i already said they could do new investments right um they could
1:36:50.320.319	1:36:54.320.319	do acquisitions with it so i mean you know any anything basically that they think would be
1:36:54.320.319	1:36:59.040.039	for the best long-term you know maximization of value of the business okay and then at what point
1:36:59.040.039	1:37:05.360.359	did they extract value surplus value from the company for like redistribution to the rest of society
1:37:05.360.359	1:37:10.400.399	is that just like a flat percentage amount or what yeah so i think that so i've i've kind of
1:37:10.400.399	1:37:14.560.560	described it as like they would have a general guidance um so for instance when you look at the
1:37:14.560.560	1:37:18.640.640	way that the nordic companies or the nordic countries manage their state-owned enterprises
1:37:19.200.199	1:37:24.160.159	the ones that they operate commercially you know for profit what they do is they have a basic dividend
1:37:24.160.159	1:37:29.360.359	guidance they say hey we want you to return you know a six percent rate of return to our initial
1:37:29.360.359	1:37:33.760.760	investment um which is to say some kind of loose dividend guidance that they would give so hey we
1:37:33.760.760	1:37:38.320.319	want you to return capital such that you're either becoming six percent more valuable and you're
1:37:38.320.319	1:37:43.440.439	returning you know a certain amount of dividends to the company or to the country at large and so i think
1:37:43.440.439	1:37:47.680.680	that you'd have this kind of loose guidance um and then to the extent that companies kind of regularly
1:37:47.680.680	1:37:52.080.079	fail to meet their guidance there need to be some kind of explanation for why that is um but then
1:37:52.080.079	1:37:56.640.640	companies would also you know you'd also probably have some incentives for paying uh extraordinary
1:37:56.640.640	1:37:59.920.920	amounts of dividends you know again you'd have like performance pay and things like that as well
1:38:00.800.800	1:38:04.320.319	okay so then okay so then just curious because my next question it goes into what you kind of
1:38:04.320.319	1:38:08.160.159	just said so what what other country are you looking at for guidance here you talked about the six
1:38:08.160.159	1:38:14.800.800	percent return who are you talking about is that norway i think this was a i think this was a swedish
1:38:14.800.800	1:38:19.440.439	report their state ownership report from 2022 if i'm not mistaken okay and then like what percentage
1:38:19.440.439	1:38:24.560.560	of their of like firms are owned by the state are we talking about like competitive firms that sell
1:38:24.560.560	1:38:28.480.479	goods and services in non-monopolistic markets so we're not just talking about like energy corporations
1:38:28.480.479	1:38:34.640.640	and stuff right no no yeah so sweden uh sweden has a mixture a mixture of a bunch of different
1:38:34.640.640	1:38:38.880.880	state-owned enterprises they're not doing exactly what i'm describing i was just using a there as
1:38:38.880.880	1:38:42.320.319	an example of how they would manage essentially extraction of profits from these companies but
1:38:43.040.039	1:38:48.080.079	what sweden does is they have a bunch of different state ownership state-owned companies um they
1:38:48.080.079	1:38:53.120.119	separate these companies into two buckets one is commercial one is like essentially commercial plus
1:38:53.120.119	1:38:57.360.359	where you have commercial enterprises that are meant to essentially just maximize profits and then you
1:38:57.360.359	1:39.000	have commercial enterprises that are they have other social goals an example of each would be like
1:39.000	1:39:06.480.479	uh one enterprise um i'll use norway as an example because i'm more familiar like equinor would be an
1:39:06.480.479	1:39:11.600.600	example of a purely commercial enterprise there's no social goals associated with equinor but norway
1:39:11.600.600	1:39:17.600.600	also has a state ownership company uh which is based around essentially creating art it's like hey we put
1:39:17.600.600	1:39:22.480.479	on plays and we put on you know art galleries and stuff like that like we have a balance sheet and we
1:39:22.480.479	1:39:27.040.039	have like a profit and loss statement but we're not like really expected to make money this is almost
1:39:27.040.039	1:39:31.920.920	more of like a social service with transparent accounting um that's how they do it okay wait okay
1:39:31.920.920	1:39:37.840.840	so i'm just i'm just curious like i look up sweden and it looks like sweden literally has like 43
1:39:37.840.840	1:39:45.360.359	enterprises that they own and like 60 of the portfolio value is in energy related stuff okay right right
1:39:45.360.359	1:39:52.080.079	so is norway closer to what you were talking about or you're at you're saying oh you're just looking
1:39:52.080.079	1:39:56.400.399	for examples of my system oh yeah like the closest thing like what like directionally because you keep
1:39:56.400.399	1:40:00.560.560	saying there's yeah your system is more efficient and i don't know how you say that with no evidence but
1:40:00.560.560	1:40:06.480.479	then you're like yeah yeah yeah i think in terms of an institutional framework norway and singapore
1:40:06.480.479	1:40:13.200.199	are the closest okay and then what part of norway are we looking towards here what part of norway like
1:40:13.200.199	1:40:17.200.199	their their sovereign wealth fund and their state-owned enterprises okay but for norway isn't their
1:40:17.200.199	1:40.000	sovereign wealth fund like like over 60 percent invested in like other capitalist economies with
1:40.000	1:40:27.360.359	capitalist firms and capitalist frameworks yeah so again my my ideal system would still have a stock
1:40:27.360.359	1:40:31.280.279	market and you'd still have liquid markets for things right that you could monitor so it's not
1:40:31.280.279	1:40:35.440.439	in contradiction to my system i would say another thing is that one of the reasons why how can you
1:40:35.440.439	1:40:38.640.640	have a how can you have a how can you have a stock market why would i ever buy a stock
1:40:40.160.159	1:40:44.880.880	well yeah so so you might buy a stock because you're a sole proprietor retail investor but then
1:40:44.880.880	1:40:49.040.039	obviously the holding corporations and the different capital managers would also want to buy stocks on
1:40:49.040.039	1:40:52.560.560	a liquid market because no i understand why they would want to buy stocks because they're
1:40:52.560.560	1:40.000	redistributing the profits to the end of the day back to the state but why would i like
1:40:56.800.800	1:41:02.960.960	as an individual can i buy stocks in a company yeah so i like i said i think you probably have
1:41:02.960.960	1:41:07.200.199	some system for like individual retail ownership i mean to the extent that that's offensive to
1:41:07.200.199	1:41:11.520.520	the socialists because there's some like i guess technically you're you're an equity owner right um
1:41:11.520.520	1:41:15.280.279	then you could always just say okay well we're only going to do things with these private holding
1:41:15.280.279	1:41:19.280.279	corporations but that's kind of the point no that's wait wait that's not technically that is the
1:41:19.280.279	1:41:23.440.439	point right is you're part of the ownership class when you have stock in a company so retail investment
1:41:24.960.960	1:41:28.720.720	my only point is that you would still have a stock market you'd still be incentivized to list public
1:41:28.720.720	1:41:33.680.680	shares because that's a way to raise capital on a public market right so i mean there'd still be like
1:41:33.680.680	1:41:38.480.479	a liquid financialization of assets in my market the only reason i brought up the stock market was
1:41:38.480.479	1:41:41.520.520	because why would you no this doesn't make any sense because you're saying that you would go to these
1:41:41.520.520	1:41:44.960.960	technocratic boards in order to get financing why would you also have to raise money from
1:41:44.960.960	1:41:47.920.920	individuals as well who aren't even allowed to have significant ownership because
1:41:49.280.279	1:41:52.160.159	like you said you can't hire employees and stuff in your economy i don't understand how you're gonna
1:41:52.160.159	1:41:56.960.960	be you could be like a stock owner well right right now in our in our system you know you can you can
1:41:56.960.960	1:42:00.880.880	go to like wealthy investors and just get like private capital investment but then there's also
1:42:00.880.880	1:42:05.920.920	an incentive to like go public with your company um because there's certain advantages related to
1:42:05.920.920	1:42:09.840.840	going public it you know the main advantage being that although it does come with additional
1:42:09.840.840	1:42:14.480.479	responsibilities the main advantage being that you have easier access to capital if you wanted to like
1:42:14.480.479	1:42:19.040.039	list shares in the future um and so the same incentive would exist in my current system no
1:42:19.040.039	1:42:22.400.399	well and you can't keep saying the same incentive it doesn't make any sense and you're you just
1:42:22.400.399	1:42:24.960.960	you just started that off with a company that goes public that's after you've already gotten
1:42:24.960.960	1:42.000	a large initial investment from another owner class person these people will be eliminated in
1:42.000	1:42:31.360.359	your society they don't exist anymore you cannot have an individual that is capitalizing a
1:42:31.360.359	1:42:34.560.560	business all businesses initially must be capitalized by your holding companies
1:42:35.600.600	1:42:38.800.800	so right so they would be so they would be capitalized by the holding corporations but
1:42:38.800.800	1:42:41.920.920	again there's there you'd still be incentivized to go public because i'll just use one
1:42:41.920.920	1:42:45.760.760	example let's say that you have a company you're going to start a shoe company hey guys i want money to
1:42:45.760.760	1:42.000	start this shoe company right it's like okay you know sweet you seem like a good guy we're going
1:42.000	1:42:53.840.840	to give you five million dollars to start this shoe company let's just say it explodes in value
1:42:53.840.840	1:42:58.560.560	oh you know now it's worth a hundred million dollars and we want to we want to now go public so now
1:42:58.560.560	1:43:03.360.359	it's it's essentially entirely owned by the the holding corporation as a private entity it's not
1:43:03.360.359	1:43:07.920.920	publicly traded right but now it's like okay well it's worth a hundred million dollars and this
1:43:07.920.920	1:43:11.440.439	holding corporation says you know what we want to list these shares and kind of have these other
1:43:11.440.439	1:43:15.040.039	holding corporations buy us out because this has been such a good investment for us and we have these
1:43:15.040.039	1:43:20.160.159	other things that we want to invest in we either want to pay down our debt sorry sorry what were
1:43:20.160.159	1:43:25.360.359	you saying no if the holding company wants to go public but the ceo or whatever doesn't want to
1:43:25.360.359	1:43:30.720.720	uh who wins that fight well i think that board so i think board members would be a mixture of the
1:43:30.720.720	1:43.000	state in the form of the holding corporations themselves and the workers at each individual
1:43.000	1:43:38.960.960	firm so if the workers at the firm and also the holding corporation appointees decided hey you know
1:43:38.960.960	1:43:42.400.399	this is a good idea like they would just have a vote in a discussion and that's how that decision
1:43:42.400.399	1:43:47.200.199	would go forward um and they would be the same people that would ultimately go on sorry i don't
1:43:47.200.199	1:43:51.600.600	know why you would ever vote i was going to say that you would vote to go public because the holding
1:43:51.600.600	1:43:56.480.479	corporation might say hey this has been a really profitable private investment for us but we think
1:43:56.480.479	1:44:00.640.640	that we can allocate a lot of this money more efficiently if we're able to extract out and be
1:44:00.640.640	1:44:05.600.600	able to be bought out from part of our ownership same reason why people go public today hey we want
1:44:05.600.600	1:44:09.920.920	to either make a lot of money and use that money for some other purpose in the case of a rich investor
1:44:09.920.920	1:44:14.320.319	it's like we might use that money just to consume it might use it to start another company um and the
1:44:14.320.319	1:44.000	same thing the holding corporation would have the exact same incentive you can't you keep saying the
1:44.000	1:44:21.440.439	exact same incentive it's not that's destiny you keep not understanding what i'm saying
1:44:21.440.439	1:44:25.280.279	i do understand corporation when you go public the reason why you're going to public is because you
1:44:25.280.279	1:44:28.880.880	have a failure to access a lot of capital but in your system you've got these capitalized holding
1:44:28.880.880	1:44:31.920.920	firms that already have access to theoretically infinite capital or close to infinite capital
1:44:31.920.920	1:44:35.920.920	you're talking about going public to to capture more completely that's no that's an
1:44:35.920.920	1:44:39.440.439	incomplete understanding of why corporations go public they don't go public just because they
1:44:39.440.439	1:44:45.200.199	want to access more capital the process of going public is buying out current investors right
1:44:45.200.199	1:44:49.280.279	buying out current investors you're not listing new shares on the secondary market those that money
1:44:49.280.279	1:44:53.760.760	doesn't go to the corporation it goes to current owners right and so when a whole way but
1:44:53.760.760	1:44:57.360.359	definitionally when you go public it gives you the ability to issue shares to additional owners
1:44:57.360.359	1:45:01.520.520	i believe it's 500 i think is the limit for a c-corp before or before you're or no i actually might
1:45:01.520.520	1:45:05.200.199	be right right but like but wait wait you're saying if you don't go public to raise more capital
1:45:05.200.199	1:45:10.480.479	what do you go public for what's the point of going public okay we've got the shoe company
1:45:10.480.479	1:45:13.680.680	it's probably just right now today what is the point of going public for a corporate you said
1:45:13.680.680	1:45:16.800.800	i don't understand i thought the i thought the reason why you go public is because you want to
1:45:16.800.800	1:45:20.160.159	raise additional funds especially from the public market you have to sell like all of your equity to
1:45:20.160.159	1:45:24.960.960	one person what's the point of going public it's both right you can you can raise more shares than
1:45:24.960.960	1:45:28.240.239	or i guess you can you can you can raise more shares essentially and have some of that be like
1:45:28.240.239	1:45:32.800.800	retained for the for the corporation but a big reason why a lot of companies go public is just
1:45:32.800.800	1:45:36.800.800	because current owners want to be bought out and they want to either use that money for some lavish
1:45:36.800.800	1:45:41.600.600	consumption or they want to reinvest in other ventures and so a holding corporation might say
1:45:41.600.600	1:45:45.440.439	hey look this is our private we're the only holding corporation that owns this company and it's
1:45:45.440.439	1:45.000	really profitable but we think that either this corporation needs broader access to capital
1:45.000	1:45:54.800.800	because our balance sheet can't handle it okay we want to make a load of money and get our
1:45:54.800.800	1:45:58.320.319	performance pay okay i understand help me here okay i understand what you're saying okay okay but
1:45:58.320.319	1:46:02.560.560	part of the going public is being listed on exchanges having broad access to a whole
1:46:02.560.560	1:46:06.960.960	bunch of different investors but in your world we already have all these holding firms that are
1:46:06.960.960	1:46:11.200.199	able to look at all these other things like for instance if you do a startup business your goal
1:46:11.200.199	1:46:15.760.760	to make money to get bought out isn't to go public your goal is to sell to a larger business right so
1:46:15.760.760	1:46:20.160.159	i just don't understand in your world why like other firms can always buy percentage shares of some
1:46:20.160.159	1:46:23.920.920	company they don't have to go public for other people to buy equity in the company like i don't
1:46:23.920.920	1:46:27.440.439	i just i don't think going public would ever happen because every firm can see the entire market
1:46:27.440.439	1:46:31.920.920	anyway they would have access to all of this information regardless they're like yeah i don't know why no
1:46:31.920.920	1:46.000	company would ever go public everything's basically already public anyway i think so no because
1:46.000	1:46:40.640.640	well the shares aren't the shares aren't actually listed and open for liquid sale right like that's
1:46:40.640.640	1:46:44.880.880	the big difference between private and public is like it's much easier to one list shares in the
1:46:44.880.880	1:46:48.960.960	future if you want to raise additional capital but then it's also much easier for your shares to be
1:46:48.960.960	1:46:54.240.239	bought out because it's a way bigger pool okay sure i'm just so just one more clarifying question so when
1:46:54.240.239	1:46:59.280.279	you're starting a business in your model when you start that business the holding firm has a hundred
1:46:59.280.279	1:47:03.920.920	percent of the shares of your company and nobody else can buy or sell or trade shares because i
1:47:03.920.920	1:47:08.480.479	thought before you were saying that people could buy percentages of companies is that only like once
1:47:08.480.479	1:47.000	right but those those would be the companies that are publicly traded right so you'd still have
1:47.000	1:47:16.640.640	privately traded businesses so that's why i mentioned joint ventures earlier as well that
1:47:16.640.640	1:47:20.720.720	you know you might have a situation where two holding corporations say hey you know we want to
1:47:20.720.720	1:47:24.960.960	do this joint venture together and we just own it 50 50 or maybe it would just be like you said
1:47:24.960.960	1:47:30.640.640	just 100 owned by one uh holding corporation you know because again private companies like you said
1:47:30.640.640	1:47:35.120.119	sometimes do have diverse capital stacks but a lot of the times those private companies are just 100
1:47:35.120.119	1:47:43.520.520	owned by you know single people okay all right and you said you said the nordic model is the next um
1:47:44.560.560	1:47:48.560.560	is the thing that you like the most but i feel like for you point to the sovereign wealth fund a lot
1:47:48.560.560	1:47:51.120.119	but i feel like the sovereign wealth fund is literally just investments into
1:47:51.680.680	1:47:56.240.239	other capitalist economies and firms and capitalist economies that bring up a question just real
1:47:56.240.239	1:48:01.920.920	quick for you kind of okay how would this system work with other countries like would a holding
1:48:01.920.920	1:48:09.440.439	company be allowed to invest in a uh a country with a different economic model and uh do things with
1:48:09.440.439	1:48:14.800.800	that like how would they interact what would the interaction look like yeah yeah i mean i think um
1:48:14.800.800	1:48.000	yeah i think foreign investments and um foreign direct investment would be things in my system right so to
1:48.000	1:48:24.160.159	the extent that the holding corporations thought that it would be uh you know a value proposition
1:48:24.160.159	1:48:28.960.960	to do you know entrepreneurial activity outside of the country they could do that um and to the
1:48:28.960.960	1:48:34.400.399	extent that a foreign company wanted to um you know i you know i guess to some degree if you wanted
1:48:34.400.399	1:48:38.240.239	to enter into like say a joint partnership with like a foreign company because you thought that it would be
1:48:38.240.239	1:48:43.520.520	you know substantially uh more efficient um you know yeah like i want to pay really low wages in china
1:48:43.520.520	1:48:50.640.640	to make my sneakers right yeah wick hey if you're criticizing my system because of you know trade then
1:48:50.640.640	1:48:55.840.840	i've got a i've got some bad news about capitalism right so again our current system would have market
1:48:55.840.840	1:49:00.240.239	foreign markets and allocation right if you think that's bad how does your system improve it
1:49:00.960.960	1:49:04.800.800	so my system you know this is one of the criticisms of social democrats in general is that
1:49:04.800.800	1:49:08.720.720	we don't have an internationalist model that my system to the extent that we can improve things
1:49:08.720.720	1:49:14.480.479	like foreign trade relations and you know uh climbing the value chain in other countries
1:49:14.480.479	1:49:18.560.560	that's a fiscal problem you know what would the government do to try and do that but i don't
1:49:18.560.560	1:49:23.200.199	know that there's a clean way to really accomplish that from a pre-distributive side from the companies
1:49:23.200.199	1:49:28.320.319	and uh you know in the public wealth's portfolio um so my system doesn't really i mean to the extent
1:49:28.320.319	1:49:31.440.439	that my system raises a lot more money for the government you know in theory we could have more
1:49:31.440.439	1:49:35.440.439	foreign aid and you know things like that with other countries um but that's that's been one of the
1:49:35.440.439	1:49:41.120.119	the criticisms for basically any non-internationalist socialist model i don't have a good way to you
1:49:41.120.119	1:49:44.560.560	know other than just basically saying all the other countries you do the same thing that i'm describing
1:49:44.560.560	1:49:50.480.479	um but our current system is is pretty terrible um in that regard as well um and sorry yes one more
1:49:50.480.479	1:49:56.640.640	one more question from my end if the workers in a company who obviously well i guess i'll just ask
1:49:56.640.640	1:50:02.160.159	the workers in a company say a company started the workers have uh the board or whatever the company
1:50:02.160.159	1:50:08.800.800	has say in how that company is run is that correct right say the the holding boards yeah the holding
1:50:08.800.800	1:50:16.080.079	company disagrees with the company right the so the holding corporation that the that uh invests in
1:50:16.080.079	1:50:19.440.439	the company and things like that they have a disagreement with the workers or the board of
1:50:19.440.439	1:50:24.960.960	that company who wins that fight right obviously the the boards of the corporations within the holding
1:50:24.960.960	1:50:29.600.600	company would be appointed by the holding company so you can't really have like disagreement between
1:50:29.600.600	1:50:34.560.560	these boards right i mean it'd be like it'd be like saying like what if it'd be like saying what
1:50:34.560.560	1:50:38.160.159	if the shareholders disagreed with the board of amazon it's like well that's i mean they they would
1:50:38.160.159	1:50:41.120.119	just kick out the well i think he was saying the shareholders disagree with the employees
1:50:41.840.840	1:50:47.840.840	yes the employees oh well company i work for the shoe company under this holding play we've gotten
1:50:47.840.840	1:50:52.160.159	together and we say you know what we're not being compensated enough for what we do this
1:50:52.160.159	1:50.000	percentage that the board and company is giving us it's just not enough um we want more yeah well my
1:50.000	1:51:03.600.600	system yeah my system would have a essentially a tripartite structure of you know unionization and
1:51:03.600.600	1:51:06.960.960	like worker board management right so if the workers were really pissed off about how the
1:51:06.960.960	1:51:16.100.100	holding corporation was treating them they could go on strike okay yeah so i mean i believe in union
1:51:16.100.100	1:51:20.020.020	you know again like my system i think it's important to have things like unions and stuff like that
1:51:20.020.020	1:51:25.380.380	but you know that's uh independent of my system you you can have and many countries do have publicly
1:51:25.380.380	1:51:30.900.899	owned corporations that are still union like we have the usps and they have a separate union even
1:51:30.900.899	1:51:36.580.579	though it's socially owned um and so my system would do the same thing um to the point destiny
1:51:36.580.579	1:51:40.420.420	that you made about norway and it's it's sovereign well hold on i'm sorry i just you keep saying the
1:51:40.420.420	1:51:45.140.140	same thing i'm so sorry well i guess is the reason i just wrote the reason why the postal system
1:51:45.140.140	1:51:50.340.340	my guess is probably has a union is because there's a soul there's a it's a one it's a one owner
1:51:50.340.340	1:51:55.540.539	market it's a monopoly right the united states of america is or the u.s postal service is the sole
1:51:55.540.539	1:51:59.700.699	employer of of like u.s postal service workers you kind of need a union there because you have
1:51:59.700.699	1:52:03.220.220	no negotiating power otherwise but in your world you would have multiple holding firms that are all
1:52:03.220.220	1:52:07.300.300	competing against each other so the necessity for a union isn't necessarily the same strength as you
1:52:07.300.300	1:52:12.020.020	need one against a single state-owned thing right well there's a lot of i mean there's a lot of
1:52:12.020.020	1:52:17.140.140	public employees that aren't represented by union and there's a lot of um you know private
1:52:17.140.140	1:52:20.980.979	employees that are and are not this kind of matrix includes you know all of those different
1:52:20.980.979	1:52:25.140.140	possibilities i i'm just saying that the question of like essentially how do we empower workers in
1:52:25.140.140	1:52:29.620.619	my system is a similar struggle that we see today that like you know we need to have a system of
1:52:29.620.619	1:52:34.340.340	unionization and kind of like worker board membership in an ideal sense um to try and represent the
1:52:34.340.340	1:52:38.260.260	interests of both the society that controls ultimately all these corporations but then also
1:52:38.260.260	1:52:43.460.460	the workers themselves who want to have good standards of living and not you know be miserable sure
1:52:43.460.460	1:52:50.580.579	yeah and so anyway so to address your point about norway um so yeah so they're sovereign they do have
1:52:50.580.579	1:52:54.180.180	two sovereign wealth funds one of their sovereign wealth funds is invest domestically one is invest
1:52:54.180.180	1:52:59.540.539	uh in foreign companies um the foreign one is i think it's like five or six times as big as the one
1:52:59.540.539	1:53:05.460.460	that's invested domestically um and there's two main reasons why it's invested in uh foreign companies
1:53:05.460.460	1:53:11.140.140	um one of the reasons is that number one uh or norway is just a hugely oil rich country right so they
1:53:11.140.140	1:53:16.020.020	literally like they want to diversify away from their economy because not doing so would be like
1:53:16.020.020	1:53:20.500.500	terrible for their economy because they're so oil dependent um and the second reason is that their
1:53:20.500.500	1:53:25.300.300	domestic uh liquid capital market is really quite small because they're they essentially have more
1:53:25.300.300	1:53:31.060.060	oil wealth than they have like you know private capital accumulation in some sense right and so they
1:53:31.060.060	1:53:35.940.939	kind of have to invest in like other liquid markets um the oslo stock exchange i think in a given
1:53:35.940.939	1:53:40.500.500	year is something like 30 or 40 owned by the domestic sovereign wealth fund um so the united
1:53:40.500.500	1:53:45.460.460	states by having such a huge amount of liquid wealth already domestically i did a calculation
1:53:45.460.460	1:53:50.820.819	based on a huge data set that i pulled it was something like 20 of gdp is uh is produced by just
1:53:50.820.819	1:53:56.100.100	all of the different 4 000 publicly traded corporations you know all those corporations are publicly traded so
1:53:56.100.100	1:54:01.140.140	in theory they're very easy to socialize right you just buy out the shares um and so the united
1:54:01.140.140	1:54:04.900.899	states actually has kind of a unique advantage relative to norway when it comes to utilizing a
1:54:04.900.899	1:54:11.220.220	sovereign wealth fund to socialize the means of production that but it's we have no guarantee that
1:54:11.220.220	1:54:16.820.819	it would function anywhere similarly to the norwegian sovereign wealth fund though right because
1:54:16.820.819	1:54:21.300.300	at least the sovereign wealth fund would right because well no because the the sovereign but
1:54:21.300.300	1:54:25.380.380	no but i don't talk about buying out all the companies right the norwegian sovereign wealth fund
1:54:25.380.380	1:54:29.380.380	probably owns very small stakes and everything that it invests in internationally that are all
1:54:29.380.380	1:54:32.900.899	capitalist economies that it's all deriving most of its money from you're talking about the united states
1:54:32.900.899	1:54:37.860.859	buying wholesale or 50 plus ownership controlling shares and all other domestic companies there's
1:54:37.860.859	1:54:42.820.819	no reason to assume that the returns on on the profits or whatever there would be as beneficial
1:54:42.820.819	1:54:48.260.260	as the returns on the norwegian social wealth fund profits well yeah but again so the the holding
1:54:48.260.260	1:54:51.700.699	corporations and the sovereign wealth funds themselves would be competing against each other so they
1:54:51.700.699	1:54:55.540.539	would still have you know they'd still have like kind of minority ownership and they'd be you know
1:54:55.540.539	1:55:00.980.979	selling and buying these shares in a competitive process so i think that we would still be able to have
1:55:00.980.979	1:55:05.540.539	what you're describing like not necessarily like single entity controlling shares it's just when
1:55:05.540.539	1:55:09.460.460	you accumulate all the public ownership it ends up being controlling shares but it's still like a
1:55:09.460.460	1:55:14.340.340	competitive process of uh distributed board appointments and you know technocratic management
1:55:14.340.340	1:55:18.980.979	which i think is really really important to maintain um and again you know i think i think that
1:55:18.980.979	1:55:22.660.659	my and i guess we might be circling the drain here but i think that my system is superior to yours
1:55:22.660.659	1:55:29.060.060	because um my system number one and i think directly addresses the problem of what private wealth
1:55:29.060.060	1:55:35.540.539	accumulation um and your system by relying on tax revenue i think relies on uh you know by the
1:55:35.540.539	1:55:40.660.659	literature that i'm familiar with a less efficient means to socialize their returns to capital hold
1:55:40.660.659	1:55:46.900.899	on wait just to be clear we both rely on the exact same mechanisms right so again i don't think
1:55:46.900.899	1:55:51.620.619	that my system is equivalent to a corporate tax okay wait if you're a janitor if you're a janitor
1:55:51.620.619	1:55:54.980.979	and you're working in your system where are you getting all of your money from
1:55:54.980.979	1:56:00.580.579	uh where you work how how is that place generating that much money
1:56:02.500.500	1:56:06.740.739	to pay to pay a janitor yeah janitors are not making the same amount as like an engineer if
1:56:06.740.739	1:56:09.780.779	you're like working at the think of whatever the poorest comp of fast food worker the poorest
1:56:09.780.779	1:56:15.140.140	compensation job oh well yeah i mean obviously so janitors don't work at like the janitor company
1:56:15.140.140	1:56:18.900.899	right so like there are cleaning services companies right but i mean a lot of janitors are employed by
1:56:18.900.899	1:56:23.460.460	corporations directly and so there'd be you'd have a similar diverse structure for how
1:56:24.260.260	1:56:27.860.859	you know employees are hired and like what kind of employees are getting hired sure but then let's
1:56:27.860.859	1:56:32.820.819	say it's for a small fat for a small restaurant where are the janitors in that company or in the small
1:56:32.820.819	1:56:36.980.979	restaurant company where are those people getting the majority they would need to get a lot of money
1:56:36.980.979	1:56:42.580.579	from the state right well they no i mean they would be hired either from the balance from the
1:56:42.580.579	1:56:47.540.539	balance sheet of or the cash flow operations of the restaurant itself right so they would either hire
1:56:47.540.539	1:56:52.260.260	janitors directly or they would hire they would they would contract out that yes but like a janitors
1:56:52.260.260	1:56:57.220.220	in that society in your society would have to be getting all of the profit like distribution from
1:56:57.220.220	1:57:00.980.979	also like the giant amazons of your society as well it relies on some tax mechanism some social
1:57:00.980.979	1:57:06.420.420	redistribution they would be so what what you do with the dividends is just a question for your
1:57:06.420.420	1:57:10.100.100	fiscal state so you're you're right so you could just directly give everyone a check
1:57:10.100.100	1:57:16.180.180	if uh wait hold on you keep you keep using these terms to hand wave away what what i'm saying you
1:57:16.180.180	1:57:23.220.220	say you said you said that your system directly addresses like income inequality or directly
1:57:23.220.220	1:57:26.820.819	addresses distribution of wealth and i said that no we rely on the same mechanisms and then you just
1:57:26.820.819	1:57:30.660.659	said well that's a question for the fiscal state that's yes the fiscal state is what deals with
1:57:30.660.659	1:57:36.820.819	wealth redistribution through taxation okay so in my system 100 of capital income like in an ideal
1:57:36.820.819	1:57:43.540.539	system obviously 100 of capital income is socialized in your system maybe you can raise the capital gains
1:57:43.540.539	1:57:49.060.060	tax to 60 but that's going to like destroy the economy right like we we know that capital gains
1:57:49.060.060	1:57:55.460.460	taxes are bad for investment uh allocation they're bad for investment uh uh distribution right like it
1:57:55.460.460	1:57:59.620.619	it disincentivizes investment i agree i mean but in your system we don't we have no idea if your system
1:57:59.620.619	1:58:02.980.979	works at all to be fair okay because you can't say that well in your system would work perfectly but in
1:58:02.980.979	1:58:06.660.659	mine it would destroy we have no idea your system would work we know 60 70
1:58:06.660.659	1:58:10.980.979	capital gains taxes don't work right so i mean i i think that my system you know maybe would have
1:58:10.980.979	1:58:15.380.380	a shot of working we don't know if your system could even maintain a functional society so that's
1:58:15.380.380	1:58:19.380.380	i don't think that's fair to say that we can just assume that but i'm just saying that in your system
1:58:19.380.380	1:58:23.940.939	for well you have no examples of it so you can't possibly disagree with that we have this well no
1:58:23.940.939	1:58:28.820.819	no because we have even even like really bad socialist systems like um the ussr for instance right
1:58:28.820.819	1:58:33.700.699	a terrible awful socialist system they had a functioning society right like it wasn't like the whole entire
1:58:33.700.699	1:58:41.540.539	society collapsed right well the soviet union literally did collapse okay so i don't know why
1:58:41.540.539	1:58:47.140.140	that would be funny no no the soviet union did collapse because again that was a socialist system
1:58:47.140.140	1:58:51.140.140	i've already said it's terrible right but again to say like we don't even know if your society
1:58:51.140.140	1:58:56.260.260	your system would even like like society might collapse if your system happened there's so many
1:58:56.260.260	1:59:01.700.699	substantial reasons to think that my system would work much better than the ussr and the ussr for you
1:59:01.700.699	1:59:05.140.140	you know a hundred years had like a you know a country and a government and they had services and
1:59:05.140.140	1:59:11.300.300	things like that is a terrible like 60 years yeah it wasn't 100 what was it was like the 1917
1:59:11.300.300	1:59:17.300.300	revolution all the way to the 90s so i mean that's 90 91 years yeah about 70 80 80 years
1:59:17.300.300	1:59:22.740.739	not say about we'll say about 70 years but but but okay i'm just saying that back to the directly
1:59:22.740.739	1:59:27.540.539	addressed thing right in your ideal world the people at the amazon corporation would be making way more
1:59:27.540.539	1:59:31.540.539	than the people at the pancake house corporation you'd have to find a way to get the whole
1:59:31.540.539	1:59:37.460.460	do you at least concede the point that we can't rate we we cannot literally have a 100 capital gains
1:59:37.460.460	1:59:41.780.779	tax we can't have a hundred percent wealth tax that your system you keep saying that you're said oh
1:59:41.780.779	1:59:44.900.899	you know i wouldn't want to tax that way i don't know i wouldn't want to attack i wouldn't i agree
1:59:44.900.899	1:59:48.260.260	that would be horrible i think i think the right i think corporate tax should be zero in the united
1:59:48.260.260	1:59:52.740.739	states i think we should just dramatically don't have so so that's that's in my view that's a distinct
1:59:52.740.739	1:59:56.900.899	advantage of my system is that it's much more egalitarian you couldn't get the egalitarianism of my
1:59:56.900.899	2:00:02.420.420	system under your system i'm just saying that the egalitarian upper limits of a tax uh well but
2:00:02.420.420	2:00:06.100.100	we can't we can't talk about any of your system because it's highly theoretical but i'm just saying
2:00:06.100.100	2:00:11.940.939	that the just you have you still need a government entity to reallocate money from one business to
2:00:11.940.939	2:00:15.780.779	the employees of another business now my system does it with taxation you might have a different
2:00:15.780.779	2:00:19.300.300	name for it in your system but in your system the guy that works at the pancake house versus the guy
2:00:19.300.300	2:00:24.900.899	that works in amazon's aws cluster the excess profit that he generates has to go to that pancake
2:00:24.900.899	2:00:28.100.100	house employee at some point you can call it whatever you want but it's at some point it has
2:00:28.100.100	2:00:32.420.420	to be redistributed back from fiscally so that's that's what i've said so you you interrupted my
2:00:32.420.420	2:00:36.100.100	explanation but i thought i was directly answering it the reason i said it's a fiscal decision is
2:00:36.100.100	2:00:39.380.380	because you could you could do substantially anything with that money right so i mean you
2:00:39.380.380	2:00:44.580.579	could do a ubi let's just say that you do a ubi okay so all the capital income i think it's
2:00:44.580.579	2:00:48.420.420	something like four or five trillion dollars a year is kind of like evenly distributed amongst all people
2:00:48.420.420	2:00:52.020.020	all adults that's about fifteen hundred dollars a month right i mean that's not like
2:00:52.020.020	2:00:55.780.779	an amount of money that i agree with you i think you could do it but but at that point it's not
2:00:55.780.779	2:01:00.900.899	intrinsic to your system if you're using a ubi that's the same thing as me doing welfare right
2:01:02.180.180	2:01:07.140.140	so so yeah that's what i'm saying you could tax and spend such that you get a fifteen hundred dollar
2:01:07.140.140	2:01:11.060.060	a month ubi but what i'm saying is that the taxes that you would rely on would be much more
2:01:11.060.060	2:01:15.620.619	detrimental to the economy than my system of socialization of capital and obviously you
2:01:15.620.619	2:01:19.780.779	disagree but i mean that's just that's my point i think my system's more economically efficient
2:01:19.780.779	2:01:24.180.180	okay i want to i want to start i we are circling the drain so much but i do have a couple questions
2:01:24.180.180	2:01:30.980.979	all right all right um for this with the the chat questions right hey callers why not for a little
2:01:30.980.979	2:01:42.820.819	bit but uh econoboy um i guess yes sir i'm going to ask you you mentioned banks earlier right like oh
2:01:42.820.819	2:01:47.940.939	they'll just get like loans for the banks and things like that um do banks in your system as private
2:01:47.940.939	2:01:57.620.619	entities banks would exist as you know entities owned by the public holding corporations um fair
2:01:57.620.619	2:02:04.900.899	enough uh so what is in your opinion i'm going to ask the opposite question destiny but for you
2:02:04.900.899	2:02:12.500.500	what is in one way what ways are as capitalism better right what what pros does capitalism have
2:02:13.220.220	2:02:17.140.140	that you would have to see that your system well we just can't handle this as much but i think my
2:02:17.140.140	2:02:21.060.060	system is better overall but here here and here i think capitalism does better and i'm going to ask
2:02:21.060.060	2:02:25.940.939	the opposite question to destiny in a minute go ahead i'm a little confused you're asking me to
2:02:25.940.939	2:02:29.540.539	say what are the best things about capitalism you'll mean capitalism for me and we're going to ask him
2:02:29.540.539	2:02:34.500.500	to steal man socialism okay yeah i think the steel man i think the best argument against my system
2:02:34.500.500	2:02:38.740.739	from a socialist perspective is that like i said it's not very internationalist in nature you know
2:02:38.740.739	2:02:42.980.979	it doesn't necessarily address between country inequality as well other than those countries just
2:02:42.980.979	2:02:46.740.739	adopting the same system that i'm advocating for but that's a little bit harder like it's hard for
2:02:46.740.739	2:02:50.500.500	me to say that the mexicans should do one thing and the canadians should do another thing so that's
2:02:50.500.500	2:02:55.300.300	probably one left-wing criticism of my system in terms of capitalist criticisms of my system or like
2:02:55.300.300	2:03:00.660.659	steel man capitalism from a from a more centrist perspective i would say that one of the um arguably
2:03:01.380.380	2:03:07.700.699	most fundamental problems with my system is that you do require a very very ideal institutional
2:03:07.700.699	2:03:12.900.899	framework that it's very sensible to say well econoboy look at all these examples right like this
2:03:12.900.899	2:03:17.060.060	this this book the public wealth of nations right it's not all like jerking off examples of public
2:03:17.060.060	2:03:20.980.979	wealth there's a whole chapter of that book dedicated to failed public wealth experiments
2:03:20.980.979	2:03:26.980.979	because governments oftentimes run public wealth into the ground and so it's totally fair to say
2:03:26.980.979	2:03:33.620.619	by my system being so state reliant that i'm essentially requiring a you know a kind of a perfect
2:03:33.620.619	2:03:39.140.140	state or kind of an ideal set of circumstances for it to run well i happen to think that it's possible
2:03:39.140.140	2:03:43.220.220	or probable that we could do that but that's a big disadvantage of my system relative to a
2:03:43.220.220	2:03:49.860.859	distributed system of private ownership okay same question to destiny um econoboy socialism or
2:03:49.860.859	2:03:54.580.579	socialism with econoboy characteristics if you want to call it that's what i like to call it from what you've
2:03:54.580.579	2:04:01.300.300	heard is probably the ways that you could find if any that it outperforms the current capitalist model
2:04:02.500.500	2:04:08.980.979	um i think one of the biggest issues that i think we're um facing today uh the quote the why is
2:04:08.980.979	2:04:15.220.220	economist uh gary's economics um but but i think that capital is conferring massive advantages on to
2:04:15.220.220	2:04:20.580.579	capital owners and i think there's a massive gulf growing between those that own capital and those
2:04:20.580.579	2:04:28.900.899	that don't and i think that finding a way to bring like wealth accrued via capital ownership into a more
2:04:28.900.899	2:04:34.900.899	state-owned and state distributed enterprise um i mean theoretically if you could find a way to
2:04:34.900.899	2:04:41.060.060	integrate that more with market forces or integrate that more economically that's probably a superior way
2:04:41.060.060	2:04:46.020.020	like both politically and everything else than integrating it uh with like tax policy like if you
2:04:46.020.020	2:04:51.140.140	have a corporation where if we could imagine we could just like print 50 years of history right away
2:04:51.140.140	2:04:58.180.180	and people start someplace if you have a a cooperatively owned corporation and it just is that the ceo owns
2:04:58.180.180	2:05:02.740.739	10 times more than the bottom employee and that's the most it ever is then that's a norm that carries
2:05:02.740.739	2:05:07.540.539	sport into the future probably requires less intervention from the government um to make
2:05:07.540.539	2:05:10.340.340	things fair between the lowest paid employee and the highest paid employee because that's just like
2:05:10.340.340	2:05:15.220.220	a norm that would hopefully develop and stay in place over time whereas if you have the norms that we
2:05:15.220.220	2:05:18.420.420	have today oh and and it's the thing you don't have to fight as much for policy for welfare for
2:05:18.420.420	2:05:21.620.619	ubi whatever those conversations are hopefully just not as much what we talk about politically
2:05:21.620.619	2:05:26.980.979	whereas in our system today we have to have massive fights over um we have to have massive fights
2:05:26.980.979	2:05:31.860.859	over redistribution of wealth and in my opinion people have very concept of where does wealth in this
2:05:31.860.859	2:05:36.340.340	country come from because people very much look at the uh look at the top of the pyramid and they
2:05:36.340.340	2:05:40.500.500	assume that the like the block is floating there rather than all of the piles of stuff that are
2:05:40.500.500	2:05:45.460.460	beneath that that help to support that structure so in my opinion like the greatest advantage to more
2:05:45.460.460	2:05:49.220.220	cooperatively owned economies or socially owned economies is that there's so much more economic
2:05:49.220.220	2:05:54.180.180	integration you can eliminate a lot of these uh very lame and very morally loaded fiscal questions
2:05:54.180.180	2:05:57.460.460	about how does the government steal money from rich people like give it back to poor people
2:05:57.460.460	2:06:01.540.539	because in a more socially owned economy you can kind of see like oh actually everybody is required to make
2:06:01.540.539	2:06:07.620.619	this business work if that makes sense that makes sense to me fair enough fair enough okay gang if
2:06:07.620.619	2:06:13.940.939	you want to ask either of these lovely individuals some questions if you have um comments that you want
2:06:13.940.939	2:06:19.380.380	to share uh just jump backstage we'll take a little bit of colors won't be too long and then uh we'll wrap
2:06:19.380.380	2:06:26.820.819	it up and we'll close out for the evening i i gotta say i i i have more questions and i have answers but uh
2:06:26.820.819	2:06:32.740.739	that's probably limited to the the format and the fact that we what we've gone for two hours and uh
2:06:32.740.739	2:06:37.860.859	it's a whole ass economic system so i don't think it's entirely fair to ask you to to like answer every
2:06:37.860.859	2:06:43.300.300	single question and all these things but uh fair enough let's bring on some of these individuals
2:06:43.860.859	2:06:58.140.140	and let's do it see what happens okay you're live hello welcome hello hi what you got for us hello
2:06:59.340.340	2:07:12.220.220	um i wanted to ask uh econoboy uh about his um uh like morals and ideology because he's said before that
2:07:12.220.220	2:07:19.820.819	he is uh he described himself as a liberal socialist or at least that his socialism is compatible with
2:07:19.820.819	2:07:28.220.220	liberalism um i from everything i've read uh liberalism one of the core tenets of liberalism is private
2:07:28.220.220	2:07:36.060.060	enterprise and private property but in his ideal society uh as i understand it private property
2:07:36.060.060	2:07:44.700.699	wouldn't exist and would be um highly discouraged maybe even not allowed by the state is that correct
2:07:45.580.579	2:07:51.340.340	yeah so i referenced also in the beginning of this discussion multiple liberal thinkers who really
2:07:51.340.340	2:07:54.380.380	didn't agree with that conception of liberalism or at the very least they they thought it wasn't
2:07:54.380.380	2:07:59.260.260	necessarily incompatible to have a socialist worldview but also a liberal worldview i think uh
2:07:59.260.260	2:08:04.540.539	you know j.s mill is a very well-known um historical liberal thinker um you know he's not
2:08:04.540.539	2:08:07.900.899	like right up there with like lock and hobbes and things like that but you know he's a he's pretty
2:08:08.540.539	2:08:12.780.779	well-sided liberal let's say historically and he was a socialist at the end of his life john
2:08:12.780.779	2:08:18.380.380	rawls you know perhaps the most well-known liberal thinker um contemporarily certainly in political
2:08:18.380.380	2:08:24.540.539	philosophy he's probably the most famous political philosopher um in in our contemporary time uh he
2:08:24.540.539	2:08:29.820.819	was a liberal but he also said that democratic socialism would establish his liberal ideals and
2:08:29.820.819	2:08:35.740.739	his uh his uh theory of justice um and so i think that it's important to understand that uh many
2:08:35.740.739	2:08:40.700.699	liberals do advocate for private ownership of businesses but it's not necessarily the case
2:08:40.700.699	2:08:45.740.739	that you have to be a person who advocates for the private ownership of businesses uh to be a liberal
2:08:45.740.739	2:08:49.420.420	because being a liberal is much more complicated than that you know believing in individual rights
2:08:49.420.420	2:08:54.700.699	democratic frameworks political egalitarianism you can have all those things and have uh public you
2:08:54.700.699	2:09:00.540.539	know entirely publicly owned businesses okay uh any other questions for you raymond or we're
2:09:00.540.539	2:09:09.740.739	going to cycle through these quick i was um going to ask uh if uh private enterprise is uh
2:09:09.740.739	2:09:19.660.659	uh uh uh not a priority and i've seen you say that you wouldn't uh want too much um how should i say
2:09:19.660.659	2:09:28.140.140	state oppression and state uh state means to to get rid of private property you said that you don't want
2:09:28.140.140	2:09:38.700.699	systems like the ussr and uh maybe china but is there an unacceptable um increase into things like
2:09:38.700.699	2:09:48.620.619	eminent domain and uh direct uh nationalization that you would be fine as compared to right now yeah
2:09:48.620.619	2:09:53.660.659	again so i i think that there are probably moral and practical economic upper limits to how much you
2:09:53.660.659	2:09:58.060.060	can socialize i know that destiny wanted to talk about kind of let's just kind of skip to the end
2:09:58.060.060	2:10:02.540.539	state and imagine how it would look like which is totally fine um but i do think that it's probably
2:10:02.540.539	2:10:07.180.180	sensible to say hey you know if we get to and i said that i think in my opening statement or near to it
2:10:07.180.180	2:10:10.940.939	if we get to a world where like 80 percent of businesses are publicly owned and then all of a
2:10:10.940.939	2:10:15.180.180	sudden you have this like like 20 of businesses that are just like stubbornly not selling their
2:10:15.180.180	2:10:19.580.579	shares or it's just not a good investment to buy their shares um slash it would be like really bad
2:10:19.580.579	2:10:24.460.460	for the economy to do so i'm not really so offended by the idea of allowing some trivial level of private
2:10:24.460.460	2:10:30.780.779	ownership in my society no no i'm sorry sorry i'm asking more like uh if if you have the democratic
2:10:30.780.779	2:10:38.620.619	mandate the people come to you and say bro we want to get rid of uh uh private property so we are
2:10:38.620.619	2:10:46.060.060	increasing imminent domain by 10 times with this and this and this measure or we are going to
2:10:46.060.060	2:10:52.860.859	nationalize this in this industry and you are like the prime minister or the president are you um
2:10:52.860.859	2:11:00.140.140	are your moral stopping you from going on that democratic mandate or do you say oh i believe in
2:11:00.140.140	2:11:07.500.500	democracy so if the people want um like uh the expropriation of all capital even though that's not
2:11:07.500.500	2:11:17.500.500	my uh i want voluntary transactions i will still uh support the involuntary transactions yeah like i
2:11:17.500.500	2:11:21.580.579	said i mean whether you want to make me president or not i would i would argue probably against that if
2:11:21.580.579	2:11:26.780.779	it would require some like wild level of violence or you know militarism in our society um so if they
2:11:26.780.779	2:11:32.220.220	wanted to vote me out i guess they could but like i said based on my morals and and kind of how bad i
2:11:32.220.220	2:11:36.300.300	think the trivial level of private ownership left in society would be i don't think it would be that
2:11:36.300.300	2:11:41.340.340	big of a deal to wage essentially a war uh to socialize the remaining 20 if you had to do that
2:11:41.340.340	2:11:44.380.380	also can i just say real quick because i see people saying this just a quick thing when
2:11:44.380.380	2:11:47.020.020	economy voices private property when we're talking about private property in the circumstances
2:11:47.020.020	2:11:50.700.699	we're just talking about like capital stuff we're not talking about like homes and cars
2:11:50.700.699	2:11:54.220.220	businesses right yeah i know but i see some people are saying like oh he wants to take your house or
2:11:54.220.220	2:11:57.820.819	your private property when that that's the distinguishing thing for socialists is usually
2:11:57.820.819	2:12:00.700.699	private property versus personal property socialists don't want to take your personal
2:12:00.700.699	2:12:03.660.659	property unless they're really good i guess um but when they say private property they mean like
2:12:03.660.659	2:12:07.260.260	businesses and and like revenue generating stuff is generally what people are talking about yeah
2:12:07.260.260	2:12:12.140.140	they're not going to take your playstation again okay so uh raymond thanks for calling in thanks
2:12:12.140.140	2:12:24.780.779	hello you're live thanks hello hi hi what you got hello how are you doing sir oh what's up oh this is
2:12:24.780.779	2:12:29.980.979	the guy oh my god one of my biggest fans i finally get to meet you how are you doing bro holy
2:12:29.980.979	2:12:39.980.979	oh my god why you're all politics uh i feel like you defend capitalism and against socialism
2:12:39.980.979	2:12:47.100.100	that's because it is hate spite it's a spite politics because hassan defends socialism don't
2:12:47.100.100	2:12:51.820.819	you agree what did he say what was the question can you translate for me are you defending capitalism
2:12:51.820.819	2:12:57.980.979	from spite because hassan defends social yes how did you catch me you got me you okay thanks
2:12:57.980.979	2:13:03.740.739	you aren't you seriously huh thanks for calling in buddy and how old was rose older than your mom
2:13:03.740.739	2:13:13.180.180	haha i caught him all right the dangers of open call-ins okay uh let's try someone i actually know
2:13:16.020.020	2:13:30.420.420	hello you're live hello you're live what's up so i got a question for uh a conoboy um i i i do agree
2:13:30.420.420	2:13:36.580.579	with the criticism that it seems like most of like the reasonableness um and your system comes from that
2:13:36.580.579	2:13:42.580.579	transitionary period where things aren't actually the system that you want with how massive and
2:13:42.580.579	2:13:49.460.460	impractical that transition even is what is your qualm with just like having a broader social safety net
2:13:49.460.460	2:13:55.540.539	and leaning more into like freer markets or like more protected markets like in scandinavia
2:13:55.540.539	2:14:02.660.659	than straight up socialized ownership of all profits well the problem is that these things are
2:14:02.660.659	2:14:07.140.140	not incompatible right so you can expand welfare payments and also capitalize public holding
2:14:07.140.140	2:14:13.140.140	corporations and i think also one of the big things is that um i don't think that this is very impractical
2:14:13.140.140	2:14:17.940.939	right so again i'm using norway as an example but i think there's reasons to think that the united
2:14:17.940.939	2:14:22.660.659	states would have actually an easier time of socializing production than norway but norway was able to
2:14:22.660.659	2:14:26.580.579	you know at this current present moment you know able to up social ownership to something like 40 to
2:14:26.580.579	2:14:31.540.539	45 percent of gdp and so i think that you know we can go in that direction uh that was only over the
2:14:31.540.539	2:14:35.460.460	course of basically one generation like 30 years or something like that so i mean wait stop you have
2:14:35.460.460	2:14:39.620.619	you can't keep answering that way that's not fair you're applying that norway owns 40 to 50 of all
2:14:39.620.619	2:14:44.820.819	their firms domestically or as controlling shares and like hey i'm talking about well their gdp destiny
2:14:44.820.819	2:14:47.860.859	like i don't know if it really matters about like the individual we're talking about like of all the
2:14:47.860.859	2:14:52.180.180	that the norwegians produce something like 40 to 45 of it comes from collectively owned
2:14:52.180.180	2:14:55.780.779	institutions obviously in the united states if we socialized one business that's way bigger than a
2:14:55.780.779	2:14:59.460.460	bunch of smaller businesses yeah like in terms of like the number of entities we've socialized i
2:14:59.460.460	2:15:03.460.460	guess it's only one and not a hundred yeah but it's like all of that if that all that 40 to 50 is
2:15:03.460.460	2:15:08.100.100	just the oil that they're making or it's just energy based it's not it's not really the same thing
2:15:08.100.100	2:15:12.020.020	right but i mean like i said in the united states like our you know the biggest corporations in the
2:15:12.020.020	2:15:16.420.420	united states are things like tech companies and financial institutions those are publicly traded and
2:15:16.420.420	2:15:21.300.300	easily socializable right so i mean in theory again you know because we have such a robust
2:15:21.300.300	2:15:25.460.460	capital market we would be able to sort of you know do the same incremental type things that
2:15:25.460.460	2:15:29.860.859	norway has done um but just you know buy those things out on an open market instead of instead
2:15:29.860.859	2:15:34.180.180	of having to start our own individual state-owned enterprises like oil companies and you know mineral
2:15:34.180.180	2:15:40.660.659	extraction businesses right listen my i think my issue with the conversation more so is that it's it's
2:15:41.300.300	2:15:45.700.699	socialism versus capitalism but capitalism hasn't even really gone on trial at all here it's been more
2:15:45.700.699	2:15:49.780.779	of just like kind of figuring out what your vision of socialism is and while i don't agree with
2:15:49.780.779	2:15:57.460.460	like nationalization okay figuring it out again i think that my model is pretty clear okay it's a
2:15:57.460.460	2:16:02.260.260	bunch of different publicly wick that's because you're a dumb ass and you can't seem to understand
2:16:02.260.260	2:16:08.100.100	anything that i'm saying hold on hold on i might be dumb ass that's true but if you don't know what
2:16:08.100.100	2:16:15.700.699	sovereign welfare is or a holding corporation that's cool but right you know because i'm not i'm not
2:16:15.700.699	2:16:20.500.500	trying to we're just having a debate here you guys keep saying oh it's so vague it's i can't understand
2:16:20.500.500	2:16:24.820.819	it no no it's a bunch of different corporate corporation i'm making can i it's a claim i'm
2:16:24.820.819	2:16:30.020.020	making jeb tan it's vague but it's stupid we'll have to go to the rules okay what rules there's a
2:16:30.020.020	2:16:33.780.780	i wrote a five yeah but i'm gonna get kicked and rotate it out with somebody so i just want to make
2:16:33.780.780	2:16:38.580.579	my claim really quick because wick you'll be here the whole time my claim is just in the socialism
2:16:38.580.579	2:16:43.940.940	versus capitalism conversation we haven't actually compared socialism versus capitalism we've just sort of
2:16:43.940.940	2:16:48.580.579	allowed you to paint the perfect picture of socialism and compare it to the united states
2:16:48.580.579	2:16:54.900.899	but that doesn't really compare socialism versus capitalism because take a country like singapore
2:16:54.900.899	2:16:59.780.780	i would say even though i'm not supportive of like nationalized healthcare they've shown the success
2:16:59.780.780	2:17:05.220.219	of like largely extraordinarily free markets and socialization of like a few key things that people
2:17:05.220.219	2:17:11.380.379	support like they literally have socialized the vast majority of wealth in their society with their
2:17:11.380.379	2:17:16.900.899	public holding corporation and their sovereign wealth fund no they have a sovereign wealth fund
2:17:17.940.940	2:17:23.860.860	health care but their markets are not largely controlled like they you as a person can buy can
2:17:23.860.860	2:17:28.100.100	own a business can start a business can raise cap private capital for that business they're in the
2:17:28.100.100	2:17:33.220.219	product yeah yeah no i agree they're not a socialist country okay but the idea that singapore is just
2:17:33.220.219	2:17:40.660.659	this like perfect capitalist you know utopia it's not true they have socialized with public ownership the
2:17:40.660.659	2:17:47.300.299	vast majority of the wealth and business capital in their society with socialization of those means
2:17:47.300.299	2:17:53.060.059	of production government's wealth but what i'm saying is on all the wealth all the wealth and society
2:17:53.060.059	2:17:58.580.579	in nor in singaporean society that is what i'm saying is on on the socialism versus capitalism side i
2:17:58.580.579	2:18:03.940.940	think you would agree singapore is more on the capitalist side and someone who is proponent who is a
2:18:03.940.940	2:18:09.220.219	proponent of by the metric of you have free flow of capital you have the free ability to open a private
2:18:09.220.219	2:18:13.220.219	private business raise private capital hire private employees and you're good to go okay
2:18:13.220.219	2:18:17.940.940	but in terms of all the that they produced and all the wealth they've accumulated most of it's
2:18:17.940.940	2:18:24.020.020	socially owned yeah but the means of that production is not it's publicly owned yes it is yeah you just
2:18:24.020.020	2:18:27.380.379	you just don't know what you're saying you don't know what singapore you just go read a book jesus
2:18:27.380.379	2:18:31.620.620	christ thank you for calling in we do that so stick of having to explain go read about how singapore
2:18:31.620.620	2:18:35.620.620	organizes its fucking entities and its public wealth and you tell me if that's just a bunch of
2:18:35.620.620	2:18:41.060.059	capitalism like they have collectively owned means of production to be clear your system
2:18:41.060.059	2:18:46.420.420	i couldn't do what they do in singapore right i couldn't go so my own so wick i'll explain it for
2:18:46.420.420	2:18:54.740.739	the 20th time okay in my moral framework we might get to a point where you'd have some wild needs to
2:18:54.740.739	2:18:59.860.860	do a revolution and expropriate all the landlords and capital i wouldn't advocate for doing that if we
2:18:59.860.860	2:19:07.460.459	lended there now if we got yeah yeah yeah hey wick wick again in my ideal system where we have total
2:19:07.460.459	2:19:12.820.819	public ownership it doesn't look exactly like singapore but i haven't called singapore socialist
2:19:12.820.819	2:19:18.020.020	i've only said that they're not just capitalist like dumbass jeb is saying and like you're trying
2:19:18.020.020	2:19:22.660.659	to imply those are totally different statements aren't they wick do you understand the difference
2:19:22.660.659	2:19:26.820.819	what i am saying is that the reason you understand the difference between those two statements
2:19:26.820.819	2:19:32.180.180	i don't think you're addressing what i said at all okay all right now singapore is a socialist country
2:19:32.180.180	2:19:36.900.899	so is norway that's what i meant the whole time singapore is socialist or capitalist i'm not arguing
2:19:36.900.899	2:19:42.100.100	that that has nothing to do with i'm what i'm saying what i'm saying is that you have outlined
2:19:42.740.739	2:19:48.500.500	i could not go and just start my own business there would be money more roadblocks
2:19:48.500.500	2:19:53.780.780	socialism is different than singapore because singapore is not socialist so when you bring up
2:19:53.780.780	2:19:59.300.299	that hey accountable your system doesn't look like singapore i agree i'm only using singapore
2:19:59.300.299	2:20:04.020.020	as an example of what the transition would look like okay and i think that's a very sensible way
2:20:04.020.020	2:20:08.900.899	to understand hey if you want to see what the transition would look like look at a country whether
2:20:08.900.899	2:20:14.420.420	we want to do the transition or not like only matters based on where you want us to transition
2:20:14.420.420	2:20:20.660.659	to whether or not i want to go through a transition at all i have to know what we're transitioning to
2:20:20.660.659	2:20:26.100.100	is better than what we have now and i've already admitted you don't know that i've already admitted
2:20:26.100.100	2:20:30.420.420	you don't know that one system isn't going to be the same as another you got to take some risks
2:20:30.420.420	2:20:36.260.260	you know i mean goodness obviously college your ideal your ideal liberalism doesn't exist either your
2:20:36.260.260	2:20:41.620.620	ideal tax code doesn't exist either you got to make some leaps of logic you know come on okay
2:20:43.140.139	2:20:46.740.739	i've got a feeling i know what you're going to talk about sam oh yeah that's right that's right
2:20:46.740.739	2:20:51.300.299	long time no talk economy well by the way the real take is that singapore is socialist and that's
2:20:51.300.299	2:20:55.860.860	why it's underperforming relative to other people that's right okay okay okay okay either way there
2:20:55.860.860	2:20:59.940.940	so i have two questions one for destiny one for economy economy can suspect what i'm going to ask
2:20:59.940.940	2:21:04.420.420	about whatever so for destiny uh you know economy started the debate within his opening statement by
2:21:04.420.420	2:21:09.300.299	making also a moral argument you know about the inherent value that there is an egalitarianism
2:21:09.300.299	2:21:14.820.819	right an equal distribution of not even destiny can contend with tiny tim sample right that's right
2:21:15.700.700	2:21:19.300.299	we're gonna we're gonna get the utilitarianism pill whatever and disney i know you don't like
2:21:19.300.299	2:21:22.820.819	talking about like normative ethics and meta ethics and all that but like just i don't know what would
2:21:22.820.819	2:21:27.380.379	be your response to someone saying like you know there is this inherent value in equality and uh
2:21:27.380.379	2:21:33.140.139	political equality um when you say equality and i hate to do this but if we're going to do
2:21:33.860.860	2:21:37.300.299	more philosophy means whatever when you say equality what kind of equality are we talking about here
2:21:37.300.299	2:21:42.340.340	what do we mean by that yeah equality about them so you know imagine a society economy what he would
2:21:42.340.340	2:21:46.900.899	say i'm a utilitarian but whatever okay but what he would say is like okay okay i'll get i'm gonna
2:21:46.900.899	2:21:52.580.579	give this broad take on that you tell me you specified okay so in in my mind in an ideal world there is
2:21:52.580.579	2:21:57.460.459	like a floor that hopefully nobody can go beneath and if they do then they are subsidized or compensated
2:21:57.460.459	2:22:02.100.100	in some way um such that they can have like whatever bare necessities we decide somebody is entitled to
2:22:02.100.100	2:22:06.900.899	in society given that they're at least putting in the bare minimum effort um and then that's basically
2:22:06.900.899	2:22:11.940.940	what i'm looking for i think that having some form of compensation in society that is um matching the
2:22:11.940.940	2:22:15.540.540	level of effort that you're putting in i think it's good i think it's good to reward people that want
2:22:15.540.540	2:22:19.860.860	to work hard and want to achieve more or whatever i think it's fine the doctors get paid more than
2:22:19.860.860	2:22:26.900.899	um you know less educated professions i think that's okay yeah broadly speaking right right but imagine so
2:22:26.900.899	2:22:31.380.379	yeah that's the it's called instrumental value like it helps in other respects you know ensures a high
2:22:31.380.379	2:22:35.380.379	quality of life but imagine like you could have two societies that are an equal in every other
2:22:35.380.379	2:22:39.940.940	respect just like one is more equal the other isn't is that something you find inherently valuable
2:22:39.940.940	2:22:45.860.860	as well regardless of the outcomes it has on other things um that's a big thing that moved economy
2:22:45.860.860	2:22:50.580.579	he read uh philosophers that made that point he agreed and that's why he he said it as an ideal so
2:22:52.020.020	2:22:54.980.979	i think that the when you say one is more equal when it isn't you mean like in terms of
2:22:54.980.979	2:23:00.340.340	like distribution of wealth in society yeah imagine like so wealth is only a means to happiness right
2:23:00.340.340	2:23:04.820.819	so imagine like you know a society yeah so here's so this is the issue that i i would say
2:23:04.820.819	2:23:08.180.180	i would like i don't know how you want to answer this but there's a ideal level and then there's
2:23:08.180.180	2:23:11.460.459	like a practical level i would say ideally i don't think wealth inequality should matter that much at
2:23:11.460.459	2:23:14.740.739	all on a practical level it seems like a lot of other people disagree though and that's the thing
2:23:14.740.739	2:23:19.060.059	that you do have to account for that like wealth inequality in and of itself is like a massive
2:23:19.060.059	2:23:24.100.100	predictor for a lot of social ills and social unrest so like it might so for instance let's say
2:23:24.100.100	2:23:28.500.500	you're asking me in one society you know there's a guy with a super yacht and everybody else has
2:23:28.500.500	2:23:32.100.100	you know like they're nice family homes but they see the guy with the super yacht going up and down the
2:23:32.100.100	2:23:36.820.819	coast every day right and then in another society um everybody kind of lives in apartment buildings
2:23:36.820.819	2:23:41.620.620	and nobody has the super yacht um i would say well i think that the society where one guy has the super
2:23:41.620.620	2:23:45.300.299	yacht everybody else has homes is probably a better society but it seems to be the case that most people
2:23:45.300.299	2:23:50.180.180	in society actually prefer the one where everybody's in the same kind of situation right yeah so i don't
2:23:50.180.180	2:23:53.300.299	know what the actual answer is to that i guess we have to do something to address it wealth inequality
2:23:53.300.299	2:23:56.340.340	as much as we can because the perception of it if we can't change the perception of it then you have
2:23:56.340.340	2:24:01.140.139	to do something with it otherwise you elect people like donald trump right and the and the real red pill is
2:24:01.140.139	2:24:05.220.219	actually inequality doesn't have all these negative consequences people say so i just search for
2:24:05.220.219	2:24:09.860.860	example people can look up revisiting the income inequality crime puzzle by mateo pezona i think
2:24:09.860.860	2:24:14.100.100	that's his name and uh it's a paper basically meta-analysis like saying actually no whatever
2:24:14.100.100	2:24:18.020.020	either way that that's to me so for economy just very quickly so you know destiny made the point that
2:24:18.020.020	2:24:21.780.780	like you know your system might be equivalent to a system with like a really really high corporate
2:24:21.780.780	2:24:26.260.260	income tax and whatever and you made the point well no actually you know corporate profits are also
2:24:26.260.260	2:24:31.620.620	like you know uh they eat into into new investments and you and i we both talked about this before but
2:24:31.620.620	2:24:36.340.340	like that's not the case when you tax cash flow uh that there's a tax called the destination-based
2:24:36.340.340	2:24:40.660.659	cash flow tax that doesn't have this problem it just taxes cash flows which is what represents this
2:24:40.660.659	2:24:45.300.299	the value of a stock and what goes to shareholders so how's your system economy different than a
2:24:45.300.299	2:24:50.260.260	system that has just a really high dbcft destination-based cash flow tax that finances the uei how is it
2:24:50.260.260	2:24:55.460.459	different yeah yeah so my system is different because number one you would need an efficient
2:24:55.460.459	2:24:59.140.139	tax code in my system so my system wouldn't get rid of all forms of efficient taxation but then
2:24:59.140.139	2:25:04.420.420	number two it's different because the actual stock of wealth like the accumulated wealth of society
2:25:04.420.420	2:25:08.420.420	would be publicly owned instead of privately owned and that's a point that i also made to
2:25:08.420.420	2:25:12.900.899	dusty not just like the taxes would be efficient inefficient in his system practically speaking
2:25:12.900.899	2:25:17.780.780	but then also that the actual stock of wealth in society would still be privately owned and not
2:25:17.780.780	2:25:23.620.620	publicly owned which i think for egalitarian and sort of downstream reasons is just strictly worse
2:25:24.500.500	2:25:30.020.020	okay okay but yeah but okay okay if you want to end it here wait also wait real quick wait just
2:25:30.020.020	2:25:34.900.899	add on this real quick like society it doesn't really matter who owns the wealth right like the wealth
2:25:34.900.899	2:25:37.620.620	in and of itself we don't really care about it's more the fact that wealth begets more wealth and
2:25:37.620.620	2:25:42.500.500	that it generates something so we really care about like the profits generated by wealth right yeah and
2:25:42.500.500	2:25:47.860.860	before before i go i'll just make the point that you know so the you know you do own the wealth
2:25:47.860.860	2:25:52.420.420	quote unquote but i said finance it with the ubi so it's directly taking capital rents and
2:25:52.420.420	2:25:57.860.860	horizontally distributing them equally to everyone with the ubi right so there is horizontal sharing
2:25:57.860.860	2:26:01.780.780	here but whatever that's okay you can you can address you can address point if you like
2:26:02.820.819	2:26:07.300.299	and then i i'm sorry what was your point destiny my bad well you keep saying that like it's good for
2:26:07.300.299	2:26:11.220.219	society to own the wealth versus private people to own the wealth but like yeah really the whole like
2:26:11.220.219	2:26:15.460.459	the well the only reason we really care about wealth is because it generates profits generally
2:26:15.460.459	2:26:20.740.739	right well yeah and there's also i mean there's you know you can leverage your wealth and you said
2:26:20.740.739	2:26:24.420.420	wealth begets well you know all the various ways that capital can accumulate right so that's one
2:26:24.420.420	2:26:28.740.739	reason but again i think there are strict egalitarian reasons to to say that wealth accumulation in the
2:26:28.740.739	2:26:33.540.540	private hands is is is not preferable right that you know people who are wealthier i don't think
2:26:33.540.540	2:26:38.420.420	relate to average people the way that other average people relate to average people because there's
2:26:38.420.420	2:26:43.780.780	this kind of like built-in elitism to society i think that oftentimes wealth also has the downstream effect
2:26:43.780.780	2:26:49.860.860	of being very toxic for your democratic institutions right like we saw that with elon musk like under my
2:26:49.860.860	2:26:54.420.420	system people would still be rich but like if the richest person in society was worth 100 million
2:26:55.220.219	2:26:59.540.540	you wouldn't be able to buy an entire social media network and propagandize to a population you
2:26:59.540.540	2:27:04.420.420	wouldn't be able to pay for an entire presidential campaign by yourself right so those are the kind of
2:27:04.420.420	2:27:09.300.299	you know things that i'm concerned about when it comes to this great degree of wealth and equality
2:27:09.300.299	2:27:15.460.459	okay um a couple people paid me money to ask some questions so i will uh five dollars from apex they
2:27:15.460.459	2:27:20.340.340	paid you money instead of donating to charity interesting curious i am charity i'm poor okay
2:27:20.340.340	2:27:25.620.620	uh if a kind of boy would drop the hard money constraints and just call himself post kensian
2:27:25.620.620	2:27:29.940.940	or neo kensian i don't i know what you're talking about i don't know how to pronounce it
2:27:29.940.940	2:27:34.500.500	we could move on to fighting fascists again not really a question but thank you five dollars
2:27:35.380.379	2:27:41.380.379	seven dollars uh from charlie charios to say uh econoboy seems to be focused on publicly listed
2:27:41.380.379	2:27:47.620.620	companies 87 87 of us companies with revenue greater than 100 million are private how would they
2:27:47.620.620	2:27:53.700.700	function so yeah again so these public holding corporations i do focus on the publicly listed ones
2:27:53.700.700	2:27:58.180.180	because those are just the easiest to buy but you know these publicly owned corporations uh or i'm
2:27:58.180.180	2:28:03.300.299	sorry these publicly uh owned holding corporations would engage in all sorts of entrepreneurial
2:28:03.300.299	2:28:08.020.020	investment so that might include buying out public companies as well or offering capital to public or
2:28:08.020.020	2:28:12.980.979	private companies as well and offering capital to private companies um and so private companies could
2:28:12.980.979	2:28:17.940.940	also be like publicly owned again they would just be publicly owned but you know not traded on a public
2:28:17.940.940	2:28:25.780.780	stock exchange um so that's uh totally compatible with my model okay 10 pounds yeah and i was gonna say
2:28:25.780.780	2:28:29.940.940	it's also important to note that if you you know the fed has this distribution of financial accounts
2:28:29.940.940	2:28:35.060.059	right where they you know explain this and um even though there's a lot more private companies the
2:28:35.060.059	2:28:40.340.340	actual like value of those private companies is is several orders of magnitude less than the value of
2:28:40.340.340	2:28:48.580.579	public companies which is kind of interesting to think about 10 pounds for maize to say ask econoboy
2:28:48.580.579	2:28:54.580.579	how he determines if a fund is good and will the fama french five factors still hold in this system
2:28:55.220.219	2:29:03.460.459	also i believe active managed funds fail to beat the market 80 of the time yeah yeah so um just
2:29:03.460.459	2:29:07.380.379	because actively managed funds fail to beat the market doesn't mean that the process of active
2:29:07.380.379	2:29:12.580.579	management is bad for capital allocation right so we would typically say that it's more allocatively
2:29:12.580.579	2:29:16.820.819	efficient to have a competitive active process than to just have a much smaller minority of people
2:29:16.820.819	2:29:22.340.340	doing substantially the same process um when it comes to your first question about how do you um
2:29:22.340.340	2:29:26.420.420	how do you determine like which holding corporations are doing the best well you know it'd be similar to
2:29:26.420.420	2:29:30.100.100	our current system where it would be like who's actually maximizing the value of their portfolio
2:29:30.100.100	2:29:33.620.620	the best who's returning the most capital to the shareholders which would be the state
2:29:33.620.620	2:29:37.860.860	um and that would be like the triggers for their performance-based compensation as well
2:29:37.860.860	2:29:42.660.659	to your third question about the the five factor i don't i guess i just don't know what that is so
2:29:42.660.659	2:29:46.580.579	i'm not sure five factor i'm not sure what that is either you guys don't know about the form of french
2:29:46.580.579	2:29:51.940.940	five oh my god yeah i just can't believe we have this debate my god
2:29:53.780.780	2:29:58.740.739	just not sure uh ten dollars from lawson harrison to say econoboy my hatred of your ideal system is
2:29:58.740.739	2:30:03.460.459	matched only by my love of you personally two dollars from blaine's escape corner say soul prop doesn't
2:30:03.460.459	2:30:10.020.020	mean one person you could have workers 30 some sort of currency says i foresee extreme brain drain
2:30:10.020.020	2:30:14.580.579	in the future of this system skilled people wait who said the sole proprietors mean you can have
2:30:14.580.579	2:30:19.220.219	employees how you have a w2 employee in a sole proprietor structure like can you issue w2 as
2:30:19.220.219	2:30:24.820.819	an individual i feel like you don't you need an llc for that yeah i don't really think a sole proprietor
2:30:24.820.819	2:30:29.060.059	i don't think you would call like a guy who owns a hundred percent of a small company like a sole
2:30:29.060.059	2:30:34.260.260	proprietor but i maybe you would well you own the company so i say sole proprietor when i say
2:30:34.260.260	2:30:40.180.180	sole proprietor i mean like one guy doing a business not you know one person owning a business so just but
2:30:40.180.180	2:30:46.020.020	that i think that was clear in the debate so 30 this currency to say i foresee extreme brain drain
2:30:46.020.020	2:30:50.580.579	in the future brain drain in the future of the system skilled people will just move to countries
2:30:50.580.579	2:30:56.580.579	that will allow them to be paid more and hold capital yeah i mean again in my system you know
2:30:56.580.579	2:31:01.380.379	more skilled employees are paid more than other people right so it there is a question open question
2:31:01.380.379	2:31:07.700.700	as to like and we talked about in the debate of like how much does the prospect of capital ownership
2:31:07.700.700	2:31:14.260.260	incentivize people to work and do productive things and you know i mean we can only there's
2:31:14.260.260	2:31:18.260.260	only so much evidence to say one way or another right but i'll just say like do this for free
2:31:19.140.139	2:31:25.380.379	like i will pull these yeah but well right but i mean you're obviously you you might do it if you
2:31:25.380.379	2:31:28.900.899	were just paid a lot of money by some other company to do it right so i mean it's it's not
2:31:28.900.899	2:31:32.660.659	necessarily the case that we wouldn't have like people do entrepreneurial investing just because
2:31:32.660.659	2:31:36.340.340	they don't have the prospect of ownership they would still have the prospect of performance-based
2:31:36.340.340	2:31:41.460.459	pay and you know just like high pay skills in general um and so like that's you know to me
2:31:41.460.459	2:31:45.780.780	kind of a big thing again like that's why i kind of ground my example in to a lot of the billionaires
2:31:45.780.780	2:31:52.260.260	who tell their stories um they they start out with like really a much smaller amount of capital
2:31:52.260.260	2:31:57.220.219	and like their idea their original like that sort of like time zero entrepreneurial activity
2:31:57.220.219	2:32:01.380.379	was done with a much smaller amount of capital than obviously the amount of capital that they've
2:32:01.380.379	2:32:06.020.020	been able to accumulate on account of their ownership over time right so that's why i say like hey
2:32:06.420.420	2:32:10.980.979	for a number of reasons my system i think uh would you know in many respects be more entrepreneurial
2:32:12.660.659	2:32:18.580.579	200 norwegian crowns to say here wick hope this helps with the headache these are capitalist
2:32:18.580.579	2:32:24.260.260	norwegian crowns don't let anyone say different no ten dollars andrew steel to say socialism removes
2:32:24.260.260	2:32:29.380.379	all personal incentive to perform better that's the core problem it throws away the incentive structure
2:32:29.380.379	2:32:35.780.780	that works in the real world people want to own their own stuff and time we we certainly didn't just
2:32:35.780.780	2:32:41.780.780	have a two-hour discussion of how i you know to a pretty specific degree incentivize people to do
2:32:41.780.780	2:32:47.140.139	more and do productive things but i guess if you know what's the what's the reading uh comprehension
2:32:47.140.139	2:32:51.540.540	equivalent to watching videos that this guy doesn't have good like i guess listening comprehension would
2:32:51.540.540	2:32:56.980.979	be the word i mean media let's go back and watch the vod where yeah just go back and watch the vod
2:32:56.980.979	2:33:03.060.059	where i spoke just just so much about how you incentivize people to do like entrepreneurial activity
2:33:03.060.059	2:33:07.940.940	and like you know why would people why would people work more under your system well because they get
2:33:07.940.940	2:33:12.660.659	paid more like what the like that seems like a pretty clear answer so five dollars from noonian star
2:33:12.660.659	2:33:17.940.940	to say conoboy has succeeded in renaming his bureaucratic capitalist pipe dream of his own
2:33:17.940.940	2:33:24.420.420	as socialism that's right you know socialism or i'm sorry capitalism is when you yeah my system where
2:33:24.420.420	2:33:29.620.620	all the capital is publicly owned is just capitalism capitalism where everything's publicly owned is
2:33:29.620.620	2:33:35.140.139	just capitalism i hear this from so many really big-brained people you know it's it's not socialism
2:33:35.140.139	2:33:40.900.899	it's just capitalism where everything's socially owned that's that's a new one for me personally just
2:33:40.900.899	2:33:45.380.379	you know make that one make sense guys well to make it make sense the argument would be that
2:33:45.380.379	2:33:50.740.739	there are workers who are producing a disproportionate amount of stuff and a disproportionate amount of
2:33:50.740.739	2:33:54.020.020	their surplus values being taken by the state and redistributed to other workers so it's more of a
2:33:54.020.020	2:33:57.300.299	state capitalist model than a socialist model because you don't actually own your labor and you're
2:33:57.300.299	2:34:00.980.979	alienated from it the same way you would be in a capitalist system right that's the marxist
2:34:00.980.979	2:34:05.860.860	conception of socialism but again the broadest the broadest umbrella of socialism is just collective
2:34:05.860.860	2:34:09.700.700	ownership of the means of production look ultimately if you guys out there want to call my system
2:34:09.700.700	2:34:14.740.739	capitalism fine but if you're not calling it bad i don't really care that much about the label
2:34:14.740.739	2:34:18.180.180	honestly true but i would say i just think it happens to be socialism collective ownership of
2:34:18.180.180	2:34:21.380.379	the means of production there is no collective ownership of the means of production though in
2:34:21.380.379	2:34:26.260.260	your system right it's the government owns the means of production social ownership social ownership
2:34:26.260.260	2:34:30.100.100	but it's the government it's a state owned enterprise seos or s of state-owned enterprise
2:34:30.100.100	2:34:34.580.579	not socially owned enterprise right so just because so just because the state is managing it
2:34:34.580.579	2:34:37.860.860	just because you're outsourcing the management of that capital doesn't mean you don't own it
2:34:37.860.860	2:34:40.900.899	similar to how you mentioned how just because vanguard is allocating your
2:34:40.900.899	2:34:44.580.579	capital doesn't mean you don't own that capital no but i can sell my shares
2:34:44.580.579	2:34:50.660.659	on vanguard i can't sell my shares in a state-owned enterprise but i don't i don't i just don't think
2:34:50.660.659	2:34:54.640.639	that's a i don't think that's a more meaningful uh you know i don't think that's like a more
2:34:54.640.639	2:34:58.660.659	meaningful way to understand like public ownership as well when you talk about i mean we said but
2:34:58.660.659	2:35:02.740.739	i'm just saying like if you had a doctor working at a place he's producing a great deal more more
2:35:02.740.739	2:35:07.220.219	of his surplus values being taken from him right exploited and then it's being given to the state
2:35:07.220.219	2:35:10.600.600	that's then redistributing it to it so he's still alienated from his labor he still doesn't have
2:35:10.600.600	2:35:13.860.860	the ownership of the goods and services he's producing for society yeah if you have if you
2:35:13.860.860	2:35:17.860.860	have a marxist conception of socialism or just like this kind of like labor theory of value kind
2:35:17.860.860	2:35:22.880.879	of conception of socialism then of course my system is not socialism but again like i think it's i just
2:35:22.880.879	2:35:28.520.520	think it's kind of brain dead to say like my system is just capitalism when my system has essentially
2:35:28.520.520	2:35:32.360.360	to entirely collectively owned means of production right um i think that's at least at least at the
2:35:32.360.360	2:35:37.480.479	very least we could say that to the extent that a socialist system is the decommodification of
2:35:37.480.479	2:35:44.920.920	labor and you know socialization of ownership my system is at least a socialist project a socialist
2:35:44.920.920	2:35:49.440.440	step in the socialist direction well but not well you say decommodification of labor but labor is still
2:35:49.440.440	2:35:52.280.280	just as commodified you said you would pay different people different amounts based on the work they
2:35:52.280.280	2:35:56.080.079	do right it's definitely right right but again like to the extent that you need social ownership
2:35:56.080.079	2:36:01.280.280	and decommodification at least the social ownership part is a step towards socialism i guess but you
2:36:01.280.280	2:36:05.220.219	don't have social ownership it's just state-owned enterprises there's no social ownership it's just
2:36:05.220.219	2:36:10.780.780	owned by the state but so again i i think there i think that there you can call my system ownership
2:36:10.780.780	2:36:15.020.020	because it's public ownership many like democratic socialists in history have had a conception of
2:36:15.020.020	2:36:19.220.219	social ownership where the state would essentially nationalize industries and you know like again if
2:36:19.220.219	2:36:23.660.659	people have a semantic disagreement about like no no it has to be like individual accounts or it has to
2:36:23.660.659	2:36:28.320.319	be like essentially worker ownership in some way like transferable worker ownership then would you say
2:36:28.320.319	2:36:31.820.819	like in china would you consider that like social ownership the stuff that the ccp has
2:36:31.820.819	2:36:37.040.040	well it's a that's what i would call state ownership because they don't have a democratic system right
2:36:37.040.040	2:36:40.560.559	so i mean in terms of how you're accessing the wealth it's hard to say that the average chinese
2:36:40.560.559	2:36:44.800.799	person has meaningful access to public wealth because they literally don't like they don't vote on what
2:36:44.800.799	2:36:48.600.600	to do with public wealth but in a democratic system you do vote like you will know because it
2:36:48.600.600	2:36:52.400.399	wouldn't be voted it would be it would be helped with by the technocrats that are managing the
2:36:52.400.399	2:36:57.380.379	holding companies right so that's my that's my recommendation for how to manage public wealth but
2:36:57.380.379	2:37:02.500.500	obviously a society at large is determining how to manage it so similarly to how again if i say i
2:37:02.500.500	2:37:07.380.379	want my i want my wealth to be managed in a passive way or i want my wealth to be managed by some other
2:37:07.380.379	2:37:12.820.819	firm doing the actual allocation that doesn't mean i don't own it right so i think that the democratic
2:37:12.820.819	2:37:17.780.780	nature of my ownership is what makes it like social ownership relative to china um you've made the point
2:37:17.780.780	2:37:21.220.219	about individual accounts being a big difference but i just i don't happen to think that that's that big
2:37:21.220.219	2:37:28.020.020	of a difference personally okay five dollars from metal rules to say econoboy you gave the norway
2:37:28.020.020	2:37:32.740.739	example but their sovereign fund is barred from investing in their domestic companies but you
2:37:32.740.739	2:37:39.060.059	want to do the opposite here it's you're right we didn't talk about that in this discussion we never
2:37:39.060.059	2:37:44.260.260	talked about that that wasn't a thing that we brought up so reading this no i know i know i just man i've
2:37:44.260.260	2:37:50.580.579	only answered a hundred questions the same way a hundred times so i do understand they have two
2:37:50.580.579	2:37:56.260.260	different sovereign wealth funds one of them is invested in the domestic economy which is several
2:37:56.260.260	2:38:00.340.340	times small it's like five or six times smaller than the other one that's the big boy also known
2:38:00.340.340	2:38:05.460.459	as the oil fund which is invested in foreign capital so i'll repeat myself okay and wick you're
2:38:05.460.459	2:38:08.420.420	making me do this because your goddamn audience member didn't hear me the first time okay
2:38:09.140.139	2:38:15.860.860	i happen to think that the us because it has a much bigger financialization of capital and financial
2:38:15.860.860	2:38:22.660.659	market would have an easier time using a sovereign wealth fund to establish social ownership because so
2:38:22.660.659	2:38:28.500.500	many more valuable domestically owned companies are traded on the us stock exchange the oslo stock
2:38:28.500.500	2:38:34.580.579	exchange is very small because it's literally just a very very small not very diversified economy right
2:38:34.580.579	2:38:40.100.100	so you know that's that's the answer again you know go back and watch it a second time if you want
2:38:40.100.100	2:38:46.180.180	for ten dollars from cameron swan to say destiny do you think the criticism of socialism has never
2:38:46.180.180	2:38:50.340.340	worked in the past is fair given that the same critique was used against founders creating a
2:38:50.340.340	2:38:56.020.020	constitutional democratic republic for the first time um no i don't think you can say just because
2:38:56.020.020	2:39:00.260.260	something hasn't worked it won't work in the future that's as stupid as saying just because new
2:39:00.260.260	2:39:04.500.500	things have worked in the past that every new thing will work in the future right um the generally when
2:39:04.500.500	2:39:09.380.379	i bring that argument out usually it's to address the fact that like it's very frustrating to have
2:39:09.380.379	2:39:13.780.780	to deal with all the messy realities of your implementation of your current system and then
2:39:13.780.780	2:39:19.060.059	to pretend like that's being compared to the actual to the um to the like neurona of some other systems
2:39:19.060.059	2:39:23.620.620	usually also but i never dismiss like i haven't said over and over again to kind of boy oh well your
2:39:23.620.620	2:39:27.060.059	system is hypothetical and idealized right i'm trying to attack it on grounds that i think have
2:39:27.060.059	2:39:30.020.020	substance in terms of how would you allocate capital you know what would profits look like
2:39:30.020.020	2:39:33.220.219	what would other things like i'm making substantive attacks so if you've heard this entire conversation
2:39:33.220.219	2:39:36.580.579	and you think it's just me saying well this hasn't worked in the past so therefore won't work in the
2:39:36.580.579	2:39:40.900.899	future like you're not paying attention number one number two when you look at how people were
2:39:40.900.899	2:39:46.100.100	designing the u.s government you are so unbelievably historically illiterate if you think that this was
2:39:46.100.100	2:39:50.820.819	just a random shot in the dark uh if you go through the federalist papers they are constantly
2:39:50.820.819	2:39:56.580.579	considering prior forms of governance they are drawing on so much um you know in discussions do we have a
2:39:56.580.579	2:40:00.660.659	single executive or a w a double executive when they talk about the whole legal framework was borrowed
2:40:00.660.659	2:40:05.540.540	from the common law system um the whole concept of like you know the magna carta and you know even
2:40:05.540.540	2:40:10.100.100	the king has to answer to some kind of like legal authority like all of these things are drawn upon
2:40:10.100.100	2:40:13.700.700	to create the framework that eventually was the united states of america so to pretend that that was
2:40:13.700.700	2:40:16.260.260	like just a shot in the dark or something like oh well they never tried it before and now they're
2:40:16.260.260	2:40:19.540.540	gonna try for the first time it's like and they knew also like that was one of the big things that
2:40:19.540.540	2:40:23.940.940	they admitted in the beginning that this was a radical new experiment a radical new thing like that was
2:40:23.940.940	2:40:28.820.819	conceded at the time i think even abe lincoln said that uh like the main purpose of the civil war was
2:40:28.820.819	2:40:32.420.420	like to hold the union together i think i think he said if i could if i could save the union without
2:40:32.420.420	2:40:36.260.260	freeing a single slave i would do so so like yeah i don't think that that i don't think the same
2:40:36.260.260	2:40:40.740.739	is anywhere near the only guy thought it was but thanks for that one fair enough uh five dollars
2:40:40.740.739	2:40:44.740.739	to score and one to say even if his system is feasible is it really that much better than if we
2:40:44.740.739	2:40:50.900.899	just put in a little more regulation or work into what we already have and uh his in this context is
2:40:50.900.899	2:41:00.660.659	uh kind of boys like yeah what why revamp or rehaul when we could just iterate so so again you know i
2:41:00.660.659	2:41:05.700.700	do advocate for iteration and incrementalism so i do advocate we didn't talk about that we wanted to
2:41:05.700.700	2:41:11.220.219	keep it in the ideal system so but i do obviously advocate for a methodical transition where we take
2:41:11.220.219	2:41:17.620.620	a lot of these private assets and slowly socialize them over time um and you know that is what i believe
2:41:17.620.620	2:41:21.860.860	in that's one of the reasons why i reference places like singapore norway not because they're
2:41:21.860.860	2:41:27.540.540	socialist ideals but because they are at least examples of countries that have engaged in this
2:41:27.540.540	2:41:33.300.299	process of socialization and i think at the very least we could say that in that process of
2:41:33.300.299	2:41:40.420.420	socialization they've done a lot of good for their people okay 10 pounds from jacob buckingham to ask
2:41:40.420.420	2:41:47.540.540	what are destiny and economy's thoughts on georgism i think it's based uh it seems okay i don't
2:41:47.540.540	2:41:54.820.819	have a strong thoughts on it but uh five dollars from aka buttozai uh so he doesn't know how it's
2:41:54.820.819	2:41:59.780.780	going to help others but he knows it's going to hurt billionaires blinks magnus for ten dollars says
2:41:59.780.780	2:42:04.580.579	econoboy saw you change the flags in your background i'm sure the soviet flag was tongue-in-cheek i'm
2:42:04.580.579	2:42:09.860.860	just curious if you'd put a swastika behind you if destiny called you a nazi jesus you know like dusty
2:42:09.860.860	2:42:14.900.899	said you you can't buy a swastika on amazon and that's probably because just generally speaking my
2:42:14.900.899	2:42:19.060.059	instinct i think hutch said the same thing when he talked to wick you know is that the swastika is
2:42:19.060.059	2:42:25.060.059	considered a much more evil and generally offensive thing than a hammer and sickle you know a lot of
2:42:25.060.059	2:42:30.420.420	people have hammer and sickles um even today so i don't know should it be that's a question we might
2:42:30.420.420	2:42:36.100.100	debate that sometime ryan five dollars a co econoboy says that in transition we can get more and more
2:42:36.100.100	2:42:41.060.059	public ownership how easy is it for a private investment to crowd out public or transition back
2:42:43.140.139	2:42:47.860.860	good god read that again i'm sorry oh what he's asking basically is say you're going on there
2:42:47.860.860	2:42:52.340.340	you're transitioning to your system and there hits a point where you're like oh we've made everything
2:42:52.340.340	2:42:58.500.500	worse what's the mechanism to re-transition to um to de-transition if you want to say that you just
2:42:58.500.500	2:43:05.460.459	privatize public assets that's all you would do okay uh shave dog's ass for ten dollars to say
2:43:05.460.459	2:43:09.300.299	sounds like a kind of boy as much as he wants to avoid it basically wants state capitalist chinese
2:43:09.300.299	2:43:14.500.500	style markets but with rule of laws of focus rather than party rule that's right i just want
2:43:14.500.500	2:43:19.620.620	my system is just capitalism guys never forget keep going five dollars from prismagic to say
2:43:20.260.260	2:43:24.340.340	chill on the smugness people aren't dumb because they don't understand you're a terrible communicator
2:43:24.340.340	2:43:30.820.819	that can't explain unautistically sure sure yeah the guys who asked questions that i directly spoke
2:43:30.820.819	2:43:34.820.819	about in the course of the debate you know of course you know it's it's me that has the problem
2:43:34.820.819	2:43:38.180.180	communicating i admit look i'm not the best communicator on the planet but like
2:43:38.180.180	2:43:41.940.940	it does get a little bit frustrating when people like you know you have like thousands of people
2:43:41.940.940	2:43:45.700.700	that are like accountable your system's just capitalism i don't understand how it's socialism
2:43:45.700.700	2:43:49.060.059	answered a thousand times in a thousand different mediums this literally started out
2:43:49.060.059	2:43:55.060.059	with me writing a whole three-part article series fully explaining my exact transition right
2:43:55.060.059	2:43:58.820.819	well the five thousand words was just the third part right it takes 30 minutes to read right and
2:43:58.820.819	2:44:03.140.139	people are like i don't understand it how does it i don't get it and it's like god damn i literally
2:44:03.140.139	2:44:07.140.139	spelled it out like i you know it's like i read the public wealth of nations and copied a lot of that
2:44:07.140.139	2:44:11.140.139	stuff over like i read that book and was able to understand it i don't think i'm using fundamentally
2:44:11.140.139	2:44:15.780.780	different grammar than the guy like i don't think i'm the smartest guy in the world either but you know
2:44:15.780.780	2:44:20.100.100	guys five dollars from blaine's escape corner to say do you think if you keep answering the same
2:44:20.100.100	2:44:25.220.219	questions with the same answers you might suck at answering communication is on you to explain better
2:44:25.220.219	2:44:30.740.739	no i don't think so and then finally i thought i was under norwegian crowns to say i'm so tired of
2:44:30.740.739	2:44:34.900.899	hearing socialists use my country as a lube to sneak in socialism also that's right we don't have
2:44:34.900.899	2:44:42.100.100	wealth funds so okay so number one you do this is another fun example of of norwegians saying i'm
2:44:42.100.100	2:44:48.260.260	norwegian and i happen to understand that my economy is not socialist oh by the way we only have one
2:44:48.260.260	2:44:54.260.260	well no you have the global pension fund global and you have the global pension fund norway those are
2:44:54.260.260	2:44:59.940.940	two different sovereign wealth funds that you luckily have access to as a norwegian citizen if you
2:44:59.940.940	2:45:05.060.059	don't understand your own country that's fine but don't say you do just because you happen to be
2:45:05.060.059	2:45:09.380.379	from there i'm from america and i think dusty and wick would agree there's a lot of americans that
2:45:09.380.379	2:45:13.300.299	don't know about when it comes to america okay that's one of the problems we might have in a
2:45:13.300.299	2:45:19.220.219	fundamental sense right so come on guys let's just you know let's be real here and with that i debated a
2:45:19.220.219	2:45:23.780.780	lot of um people from the uk who didn't know that they voted on their members of european parliament
2:45:23.780.780	2:45:30.820.819	so yeah okay so thank you yeah thanks for coming gang i'm gonna give each of you a closing statements
2:45:30.820.819	2:45:35.860.860	and tell people where they can find you i have a link to econoboy's sub stack if you want if you
2:45:35.860.860	2:45:43.300.299	would rather read than listen uh you can find the answers to your questions there um we're gonna give
2:45:43.300.299	2:45:47.620.620	the mic first to destiny and then we're gonna let econoboy have the last word so go ahead destiny
2:45:47.620.620	2:45:52.340.340	close us up yeah i think economy just wants capital no i'm just kidding um i mean like i'm half king i feel
2:45:52.340.340	2:45:57.060.059	like when people talk about um i think when people talk about socialism in its like most hardcore form
2:45:57.060.059	2:46:00.260.260	i think we're usually talking about like means and motor production so we're getting rid of private
2:46:00.260.260	2:46:04.500.500	ownership which means you don't have individuals making decisions about which businesses to start
2:46:04.500.500	2:46:09.380.379	you don't have an owner class that's extracting value from laborers and then you're changing your
2:46:10.260.260	2:46:13.860.860	your motor production such that like you're not responding to market incentives anymore like
2:46:13.860.860	2:46:19.620.620	there's a central committee that's telling you what to make um obviously there are huge criticisms with
2:46:19.620.620	2:46:26.260.260	both of these things um but i feel like a lot of this kind of socialism light or softer socialism
2:46:26.260.260	2:46:32.660.659	that gets suggested today um tries to avoid both of these things by introducing um either capitalistic
2:46:32.660.659	2:46:37.540.540	elements in terms of how firms are ran or market forces that are still working and then they try to
2:46:37.540.540	2:46:43.060.059	substitute out basically like investors or capital owners for these quasi state managed enterprises
2:46:43.060.059	2:46:47.860.860	and i i feel like i do feel like we're essentially kind of like recreating capitalism
2:46:47.860.860	2:46:52.100.100	and we're trying very very very desperately to salvage all the pros of capitalism while getting rid of
2:46:52.100.100	2:46:57.620.620	the cons which i'm actually like in in concept i'm actually okay with that i think we should try
2:46:57.620.620	2:47:01.460.459	to salvage good things and get rid of bad things from systems rather than get rid of the thing itself
2:47:01.460.459	2:47:06.740.739	i just i feel like um this it's not really related to this debate but i really do feel like
2:47:06.740.739	2:47:10.900.899	it sucks but i feel like solving a lot of the wealth inequality today in the united states i think
2:47:10.900.899	2:47:16.340.340	is actually incredibly easy it's just very politically unpopular i think that um and maybe even a
2:47:16.340.340	2:47:20.820.819	economy boy would agree i think that if you were to literally bump up like all of the tax brackets
2:47:20.820.819	2:47:27.060.059	by like five to eight points um and bump up like your capital gains by like 20 to 25 points i would be
2:47:27.060.059	2:47:31.620.620	surprised if there was this massive exodus of wealth if there was this massive destruction of
2:47:31.620.620	2:47:36.180.180	the economy i think that you would raise on the order of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars
2:47:36.740.739	2:47:41.620.620	in order to do more projects and i think the country would truck along just fine um and i feel like
2:47:41.620.620	2:47:45.940.940	this is just a way better approach to things than to try to like radically redesign the entire
2:47:45.940.940	2:47:49.540.540	economy um a lot of what we talked about today was kind of like the hypothetical way we would do this
2:47:49.540.540	2:47:53.700.700	domestically but we didn't even really scratch the surface of what does it look like internationally
2:47:53.700.700	2:47:57.780.780	and if you remember like one of the biggest criticisms of uh capitalists when they say well
2:47:57.780.780	2:48:00.980.979	didn't all the socialist economies fail other people just say oh well that's because capitalist
2:48:00.980.979	2:48:04.500.500	economies killed them all and it's like okay well why wouldn't that happen again would all the
2:48:04.500.500	2:48:10.580.579	capital investment just go to canada or mexico um yeah but i mean um i guess in a way this
2:48:10.580.579	2:48:14.660.659	debate is kind of like the reverse of how it normally goes generally um the socialist gets to
2:48:14.660.659	2:48:18.340.340	critique the capitalist constantly and the socialist has like their perfect system and then the capitalists
2:48:18.340.340	2:48:21.780.780	to see what the best realities of their system but in this debate the tables are kind of turned so
2:48:21.780.780	2:48:25.460.459	it's harder for econoboy because i'm basically just getting to launch like a massive internal
2:48:25.460.459	2:48:28.260.260	critique which is challenging you're asking somebody to solve a whole bunch of different
2:48:28.260.260	2:48:32.180.180	problems that might manifest in a bunch of different ways and then i can always retreat behind
2:48:32.180.180	2:48:36.500.500	the curtain of saying well my economy works right now doesn't it so thank you um so it makes it a
2:48:36.500.500	2:48:41.380.379	little bit easier from my perspective but yeah that's larger than my thoughts on that thanks for
2:48:41.380.379	2:48:47.060.059	being here and i did ask him the question of how this would work internationally but uh he didn't
2:48:47.060.059	2:48:51.300.299	like that question and so that was well i did answer it directly but maybe it was too confusing
2:48:51.300.299	2:48:57.140.139	an answer it might have been too confusing for me but i did literally say exactly how that would work
2:48:57.140.139	2:49:03.380.379	you know but goddamn i do use really can i just i'm just a dumb communicator i guess what can i say guys
2:49:03.380.379	2:49:08.740.739	um but anyway yeah my final statement guys so i mean look i just i think that fundamentally we were
2:49:08.740.739	2:49:12.580.579	stuck in kind of our ideal framework for a long time of this debate and that's totally fine but i
2:49:12.580.579	2:49:17.380.379	think that part of the reason for that is i don't know if it's strategic on dusty's part um or it's
2:49:17.380.379	2:49:21.300.299	just like that's just kind of like we want to talk about ideal socialism versus like current existing
2:49:21.300.299	2:49:25.460.459	capitalism which is fine but i think at the very least the transitionary stage is very hard to argue
2:49:25.460.459	2:49:29.060.059	against right like that we do actually have a ton of examples like to the extent that we don't have
2:49:29.060.059	2:49:34.500.500	examples of you know like actually existing ideal socialism of course i would agree with that but we do have
2:49:34.500.500	2:49:38.740.739	examples of actually existing transitions of private ownership of the means of production to
2:49:38.740.739	2:49:42.340.340	social ownership of the means of production you know we do know what it looks like for a company
2:49:42.340.340	2:49:45.780.780	or for countries to open up public holding corporations we do know what it looks like for
2:49:45.780.780	2:49:50.260.260	countries to have sovereign wealth funds there's hundreds of thousands of examples of these
2:49:50.260.260	2:49:54.500.500	different entities across time and across countries across cultures across stages of development
2:49:55.380.379	2:49:59.460.459	and we to that extent we do know what makes them work and what makes them not work
2:49:59.460.459	2:50:04.260.260	and so to a large degree that was what um the third part of my uh uh substack on how i became a
2:50:04.260.260	2:50:09.220.219	socialist was trying to kind of surmise was what makes public wealth work and what are the good things
2:50:09.220.219	2:50:14.180.180	about public wealth um insofar as public wealth and the transition to accumulating public wealth can
2:50:14.180.180	2:50:19.220.219	work it's good because it greatly horizontalizes the wealth of society makes overall society to be much
2:50:19.220.219	2:50:24.260.260	more egalitarian and i think that there's also reason to believe that insofar as the uh there's insofar
2:50:24.260.260	2:50:30.260.260	as um insofar as basically public wealth is uh horizontally owned then uh the capital income from
2:50:30.260.260	2:50:35.540.540	that uh from that wealth is able to also be used by the state for some kind of public purpose we reduce
2:50:35.540.540	2:50:40.500.500	the need to use distortionary taxes um and i think that that's a reason that especially at the very
2:50:40.500.500	2:50:45.620.620	very very very least that in transition to our system uh ideal social ownership we would absolutely
2:50:45.620.620	2:50:50.180.180	prefer the transition to just what we currently have now because what we currently have now is a
2:50:50.180.180	2:50:55.300.299	system that is radically unequal is um i think radically unfair in many ways um and at the very
2:50:55.300.299	2:51:00.260.260	least if we just started accumulating some level of public wealth um similar to how these other
2:51:00.260.260	2:51:05.460.459	societies that i've referenced have done then that's to the extent that our system would be some level
2:51:05.460.459	2:51:10.740.739	better than it is now and although like destiny said it's hard to defend like a like an unrealized
2:51:10.740.739	2:51:17.940.940	ideal i think it's very very easy to defend at least a radical transitionary process to where we get to
2:51:17.940.940	2:51:22.740.739	some like very high level of public ownership to where maybe we end up hitting that kind of upper
2:51:22.740.739	2:51:28.260.260	um upper limit and apologies for i guess being smug and being an asshole at some parts of this debate
2:51:28.260.260	2:51:33.220.219	it is a little frustrating to get asked the same question basically a thousand times and to have
2:51:33.220.219	2:51:37.460.459	answered that question within the very same conversation and then to be asked again that very
2:51:37.460.459	2:51:42.500.500	same question um i don't claim to be the best communicator but i mean when i talk to just people in
2:51:42.500.500	2:51:47.140.139	my personal life and when i talk to people um just generally speaking it just i don't know like
2:51:47.140.139	2:51:51.540.540	it just seems like this is kind of an understandable thing and um it's hard for i guess everyone to
2:51:51.540.540	2:51:55.220.219	understand it um and i'm not saying people that don't understand it are just like stupid but
2:51:55.220.219	2:51:59.860.860	i guess to some degree it is just like difficult to wrap your head around what kind of a radical
2:51:59.860.860	2:52:04.980.979	transition of our economy would look like um and so just try to read the words that i write and the
2:52:04.980.979	2:52:09.940.940	hear the words that i say and um try to you know reconcile that with our current system and come up with
2:52:09.940.940	2:52:16.660.659	critiques yourself um you know to try and kind of refine what you imagine a good economic system would look like
2:52:17.540.540	2:52:22.500.500	okay with that uh we're gonna let you guys go uh i am still gonna stream for a little bit i have
2:52:22.500.500	2:52:27.540.540	some thoughts of my own but uh thank you again for coming destiny and cowboy and i hope to see
2:52:27.540.540	2:52:35.140.139	you again in the future have a great day bye guys can we get my letter stick around if you want to
