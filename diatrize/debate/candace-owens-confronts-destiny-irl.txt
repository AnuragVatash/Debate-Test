0:00.000	0:00:01.140.139	They are not the most literate.
0:00:01.180.179	0:00:03.200.200	You think people that graduate with college degrees can't read well?
0:00:03.300.299	0:00:04.660.660	Yeah, what I'm telling you is yes.
0:00:04.740.740	0:00:05.380.379	That's what I'm telling you.
0:00:05.420.419	0:00:06.220.219	They're not the most literate.
0:00:06.420.419	0:00:08.520.519	What would I look up to verify that if I wanted to see like...
0:00:08.520.519	0:00:09.920.919	You got to do the research in your own time.
0:00:09.920.919	0:00:10.520.519	I have done the research.
0:00:10.520.519	0:00:11.220.220	Okay, I'm happy to...
0:00:11.220.220	0:00:11.880.880	That's just not true.
0:00:12.020.019	0:00:13.400.400	What do you mean it's not true?
0:00:13.520.519	0:00:14.100.099	And I'm going to tell you...
0:00:14.100.099	0:00:14.660.660	Okay, hold on.
0:00:14.660.660	0:00:15.080.080	No, I'm going to tell you.
0:00:15.080.080	0:00:16.140.140	Let me finish my name real quick.
0:00:16.280.280	0:00:16.780.780	Hold on, I'm sorry.
0:00:16.880.879	0:00:19.420.420	Because I've done a lot of research on college degrees and a lot of research on education.
0:00:19.580.579	0:00:22.700.699	And every single thing that you're saying sounds really good on like a culture war perspective.
0:00:22.700.699	0:00:26.160.160	But when you look at an actual economic perspective, when you look at actual firms that hire people,
0:00:26.380.379	0:00:29.540.539	and when you look at the actual median wages for people that even have some college education,
0:00:29.920.920	0:00:32.700.700	all of it, all of it, that's great for you.
0:00:32.760.759	0:00:34.420.420	But for the average American, that's just not true.
0:00:34.600.600	0:00:36.340.340	None of these numbers are found on average.
0:00:36.440.439	0:00:40.780.780	You will never find data that supports data that high school earners on average are earning college degree earners.
0:00:40.860.859	0:00:45.300.299	Every single person that I went to school with is not using the degrees that they paid for.
0:00:45.300.299	0:00:46.600.600	What did you go to college for?
0:00:47.460.460	0:00:47.900.899	Journalism.
0:00:48.800.799	0:00:50.140.140	Isn't that what you're doing right now?
0:00:50.620.619	0:00:51.140.140	What do you mean?
0:00:51.140.140	0:00:54.220.219	You're acting like you're a college dorm kid.
0:00:54.320.320	0:00:57.560.560	Yeah, and your catty insults towards people online make you seem like a high school mean girl.
0:00:58.440.439	0:00:59.200.200	What are you doing here?
0:00:59.260.259	0:00:59.740.740	What's going on?
0:00:59.940.939	0:01:02.760.759	I just did PBD, Patrick McDavid.
0:01:03.180.179	0:01:04.260.260	They know you over there, right?
0:01:05.780.780	0:01:06.500.500	Are you laughing?
0:01:07.460.459	0:01:07.780.780	Maybe.
0:01:08.460.459	0:01:10.060.060	Do you know Adam over there?
0:01:10.200.200	0:01:10.640.640	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
0:01:10.680.680	0:01:11.500.500	I just asked Adam.
0:01:11.580.579	0:01.000	He was like, oh, yeah.
0:01:12.100.099	0:01:12.800.799	Yeah, I know Adam.
0:01:12.840.840	0:01:13.420.420	Me and Adam are cool.
0:01:13.420.420	0:01:14.880.879	I'm not as much sure about the PBD guy.
0:01:15.060.060	0:01:19.960.959	I'm a pretty far left guy, and I disagree with a lot of stuff they say in a pretty crazy way.
0:01:19.960.959	0:01:21.220.219	They got both on that show.
0:01:21.260.260	0:01:21.920.920	That's why it's so great.
0:01:22.060.060	0:01:23.380.379	I just did something with Chris Cuomo.
0:01:23.660.659	0:01:24.380.379	He couldn't be further left.
0:01:24.460.459	0:01:25.060.060	That's what I just did.
0:01:25.120.120	0:01:25.640.640	Yeah, I saw it.
0:01:25.800.799	0:01:28.080.079	But when they bring on left guests, it's usually to roast the fuck out of them.
0:01:29.240.239	0:01:30.780.780	No, that's not what happened at all.
0:01:31.120.120	0:01:32.140.140	That might not have happened this time.
0:01:32.180.180	0:01:32.640.640	That's what I've seen.
0:01:32.720.719	0:01:34.140.140	When I had Anthony Weiner on, it was that.
0:01:34.200.200	0:01:37.320.319	When I've seen other left-leaning guests go on, it was usually like a break him over the goals.
0:01:37.320.319	0:01:39.360.359	One of them is on the left, right?
0:01:39.560.560	0:01:39.860.859	Which guy?
0:01:40.080.079	0:01:48.280.280	So I really thought that Adam just said, I've never voted for a Republican, but I might vote Republican.
0:01:48.560.560	0:01:49.640.640	I think Adam is fair.
0:01:50.140.140	0:01:50.340.340	Yeah.
0:01:50.420.420	0:01:51.760.760	I think Adam is fair, generally, from what I've seen.
0:01:51.820.819	0:01:53.360.359	But he's like center at best.
0:01:53.680.680	0:01:55.260.260	And I'm not even like a communist type guy.
0:01:55.340.340	0:01:56.380.379	But I mean, Adam is like pretty center.
0:01:56.500.500	0:02:00.640.640	He's like a, I just don't think he's behind all the Trump stuff.
0:02:00.800.799	0:02:01.560.560	But why laugh?
0:02:01.600.599	0:02:03.060.060	If I'm like, I just went Patrick Beck David.
0:02:03.120.120	0:02:04.160.159	It's like, ha ha, what's that?
0:02:04.160.159	0:02:05.900.900	Oh, sorry.
0:02:05.980.980	0:02:09.200.199	In my world, there's always a lot of drama and people hitting each other behind.
0:02:09.260.259	0:02:10.060.060	So I just laugh because it's funny.
0:02:10.160.159	0:02:11.600.599	I'm not sure if those guys hate me or not.
0:02:11.660.659	0:02:12.440.439	I've been on their show once.
0:02:12.560.560	0:02:13.480.479	They seem like cool people.
0:02:13.760.759	0:02:18.420.419	But the Patrick guy has said kind of weird things about me or my fan base before.
0:02:18.560.560	0:02:20.980.979	So it's kind of like a funny, it's just a funny thing.
0:02:21.040.039	0:02:22.080.080	There wasn't anything deeper to that, I promise.
0:02:22.080.080	0:02:22.380.379	Oh, okay.
0:02:22.460.460	0:02:23.420.419	No, I was just curious.
0:02:23.580.580	0:02:26.360.360	I was like, because you would go on a platform with someone on the right, presumably.
0:02:26.720.719	0:02:27.160.159	Yeah, of course.
0:02:27.300.300	0:02:27.540.539	Okay.
0:02:27.580.580	0:02:29.260.259	Because you said, because I'm on the left when I asked you.
0:02:34.160.159	0:02:34.820.819	I'm on the right.
0:02:34.940.939	0:02:35.920.919	It's like, what do you actually think?
0:02:36.120.120	0:02:36.280.280	You know?
0:02:36.340.340	0:02:37.360.360	What do you actually believe?
0:02:37.560.560	0:02:37.700.699	Sure.
0:02:37.840.840	0:02:38.120.120	I agree.
0:02:38.220.219	0:02:38.480.479	For sure.
0:02:38.680.680	0:02:38.780.780	Yeah.
0:02:40.280.280	0:02:43.020.020	What's your, what are you talking about mainly over the past week or two?
0:02:43.100.099	0:02:45.160.159	What's the stuff that's captured your attention, your eyes the most?
0:02:46.080.080	0:02:47.540.539	Yeah, I talk about everything on my show.
0:02:47.640.639	0:02:52.260.259	I mean, obviously, I think the biggest topic for me has been the Diddy lawsuit.
0:02:52.680.680	0:02:55.860.860	It's the craziest thing that's come out, I think, since Jeffrey Epstein.
0:02:55.860.860	0:03:01.660.659	And it's definitely significant because a lot of the work that I do is talking about just,
0:03:02.360.360	0:03:04.860.860	or I guess really asking the question is, what's happened to black culture?
0:03:04.940.939	0:03:06.780.780	Because this is not the black culture that I grew up with.
0:03:06.920.919	0:03.000	And the Diddy lawsuit potentially answers a lot of those questions.
0:03:11.680.680	0:03:13.620.620	Can you, do you say where you grew up?
0:03:14.180.180	0:03:17.120.120	I grew up, I was born in White Plains, New York, and I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut.
0:03:17.400.400	0:03:17.660.659	Okay.
0:03:19.140.139	0:03:20.800.800	Can you catch us up on the P. Diddy lawsuit?
0:03:21.220.219	0:03:22.960.960	I haven't been in this area as much.
0:03:23.220.219	0:03:23.740.740	Are you kidding?
0:03:23.740.740	0:03:27.040.039	My mind has been, I've done Israel-Palestine for the last four years, or four months,
0:03:27.120.120	0:03:28.700.699	and then like a whole bunch of red pill stuff before that.
0:03:28.820.819	0:03:29.600.599	So my mind is not.
0:03:29.900.900	0:03:33.620.620	So, in case you guys have not seen it, you can go over to my YouTube channel.
0:03:33.680.680	0:03:34.320.319	I've been covering it.
0:03:34.620.620	0:03:36.700.699	But, and if you're there, definitely subscribe.
0:03:37.600.599	0:03.000	But, so essentially, at the end of last year, Diddy was dating that girl Cassie for a long time,
0:03:43.300.300	0:03:44.020.020	about 10 years.
0:03:44.220.219	0:03:44.420.419	Okay.
0:03:44.740.740	0:03:50.560.560	And she started making allegations that Diddy was very, you know, very into,
0:03:50.820.819	0:03:53.440.439	into some very sexually deviant things, is what I would say.
0:03:54.260.259	0:03:57.460.460	And forced her to do a lot of things against her will, or drugs, whatever.
0:03:57.860.860	0:04:02.520.520	She files this lawsuit, and basically overnight, I'm obviously being a bit hyperbolic, but he
0:04:02.520.520	0:04:03.020.020	pays her off.
0:04:03.240.240	0:04:03.900.900	So it ends.
0:04:04.700.699	0:04:09.520.520	And then Cat Williams kind of, like, makes, alludes to the fact that more stuff is going
0:04:09.520.520	0:04:15.260.259	to come out in 2024, and then a producer, whose name is Rodney, drops a lawsuit, and
0:04:15.260.259	0:04:20.760.759	he alleges to have, you know, hundreds of hours of footage backing up his claims.
0:04:20.820.819	0:04:22.900.899	And in the lawsuit, he actually dropped pictures.
0:04:23.240.240	0:04:24.340.339	So it wasn't just this.
0:04:24.340.339	0:04:25.600.600	Because you can always have a frivolous lawsuit.
0:04:25.720.720	0:04:26.240.240	It can mean nothing.
0:04:27.100.100	0:04:33.700.699	And what essentially his lawsuit suggests, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, just for protection
0:04:33.700.699	0:04:36.660.660	here, is that there's a blackmail ring in Hollywood.
0:04:37.160.160	0:04:39.020.019	Diddy is a gangster.
0:04:39.020.019	0:04:47.140.139	On top of Diddy sits Lucian Grange, who is the CEO of Universal Music Group, that, and
0:04:47.140.139	0:04:49.120.120	this was, for me, one of the wildest parts.
0:04:49.440.439	0:04:53.200.199	He tells a story about one night where Diddy got mad at somebody and just shot them in, like,
0:04:53.220.220	0:04:54.200.199	the stomach and the hip.
0:04:54.420.420	0:04:57.380.379	He shows the pictures of the blood all around the bathroom, because he was right there when
0:04:57.380.379	0:05:00.800.800	the person got shot, and he allegedly went to his knees and tried to help the person.
0:05.000	0:05.000	It was Diddy and his son who allegedly shot him.
0:05.000	0:05:06.580.579	But they said that there's one person that you call when something like that happens,
0:05:06.760.759	0:05:11.160.160	and that guy's name is, like, Fahim something, and he will come clean it up.
0:05:11.340.339	0:05:15.300.300	The LAPD will write a fake police report, and he shows, like, how the news then reported
0:05:15.300.300	0:05:18.420.420	that the shooting happened outside, and then it got wiped under the rug.
0:05:18.760.759	0:05:24.080.079	And what's interesting is that guy who you call, the security guy, was the same security
0:05:24.080.079	0:05:26.820.819	person who was one of only two people there when Michael Jackson died.
0:05:27.140.139	0:05:29.740.740	So it's now reopened, all the Michael Jackson stuff.
0:05:30.980.980	0:05:31.940.939	Super interesting.
0:05:31.940.939	0:05:37.040.040	A lot of stuff that I would say, a lot of proof presented in these documents, like I
0:05:37.040.040	0:05:38.200.199	said, there's a lot of photos included.
0:05:38.780.779	0:05:44.760.759	And if what he is spelling out is correct, then it's basically a homosexual ring that
0:05:44.760.759	0:05:45.620.620	works by black males.
0:05:45.720.720	0:05:49.740.740	They host these, what he calls, freak-offs, and they drug people, and they get them to
0:05:49.740.740	0:05:54.260.259	sleep with a minor or do something, you know, that you wouldn't want publicized, and then
0:05:54.260.259	0:05:55.120.120	they own you, right?
0:05:55.160.160	0:05:59.700.699	Because it's like, well, we have you on camera doing this, and so you're going to say
0:05:59.700.699	0:06:00.780.779	or do whatever I want.
0:06:00.780.779	0:06:03.160.160	So very much like the Jeffrey Epstein stuff.
0:06:03.780.779	0:06:04.060.060	Gotcha.
0:06:04.280.279	0:06:07.540.540	Are these in indictments, or are these just like affidavits or statements to the media?
0:06:07.660.660	0:06:08.880.879	Is any of this stuff like gone to court yet?
0:06:08.960.959	0:06:10.100.100	It's the lawsuit that he filed.
0:06:10.200.199	0:06:12.580.579	So we're reading the lawsuit documents directly.
0:06:12.920.920	0:06:14.340.339	This is a civil lawsuit, I'm guessing?
0:06:14.580.579	0:06:14.860.860	Yes.
0:06.000	0:06:16.440.439	He's suing Universal Music Group.
0:06:16.520.519	0:06:19.420.420	He's suing Lucy and Grange personally.
0:06:19.420.420	0:06:25.540.540	He alleges that Lucy and Grange and Diddy are in a relationship by saying they disappear
0:06:25.540.540	0:06:29.840.839	into Diddy's room for hours, and this is the stuff that I've seen.
0:06:29.940.939	0:06:30.960.959	I was groomed for sex.
0:06:31.400.399	0:06:34.780.779	Essentially, he wasn't a gay man, but then Diddy found him when he was young.
0:06:34.980.980	0:06:35.920.920	These are the allegations he's making.
0:06:35.920.920	0:06:39.680.680	Again, a lot of photos of other rappers.
0:06:39.920.920	0:06:44.220.220	He's named like Cuba Gooding Jr., who's an actor.
0:06:45.140.139	0:06:45.860.860	It's a lot.
0:06:46.140.139	0:06:50.640.639	Is there, has any of this stuff leaked to the media in terms of pictures or strong hard
0:06:50.640.639	0:06:54.720.720	evidence, or are these mainly just in the charging documents or the civil case documents
0:06:54.720.720	0:06:54.980.980	so far?
0:06:55.200.199	0:06:59.740.740	That's also what's really interesting is that, yes, it's being covered, but not in
0:06:59.740.740	0:07:00.680.680	the way that it should be covered.
0:07:00.760.759	0:07:06.740.740	The fact that you don't know about it, to me, is crazy because we've never seen someone
0:07:06.740.740	0:07:10.760.759	with hundreds of hours of footage putting in photos like, here's a picture of a drug
0:07:10.760.759	0:07:12.700.699	that I have to carry at all times to keep Diddy high.
0:07:12.940.939	0:07:14.760.759	Here's the name of the woman that gets the drugs.
0:07:14.820.819	0:07:15.380.379	Here's a drug dealer.
0:07:15.420.420	0:07:16.940.939	Here's a photo of me with this person.
0:07.000	0:07:17.920.920	Here's the blood on the floor that night.
0:07:17.940.939	0:07:22.360.360	It's like, we've never seen this much proof to make those claims, so it's definitely
0:07:22.360.360	0:07:23.900.899	something to watch.
0:07:23.900.899	0:07:27.020.019	Somebody said, I've just seen in chat, somebody said, over $100 million to the first civil
0:07:27.020.019	0:07:28.900.899	suit that got settled in less than 24 hours.
0:07:28.960.959	0:07:29.340.339	Is that true?
0:07:29.780.779	0:07:30.160.160	What's that?
0:07:30.320.319	0:07:31.760.759	Over $100 million to...
0:07:31.760.759	0:07:34.220.220	The first civil suit that got settled in less than 24 hours.
0:07:34.260.259	0:07:35.080.079	Does that happen with this?
0:07:35.280.279	0:07:35.800.800	I have no idea.
0:07:35.900.899	0:07:39.820.819	We might be talking about Cassie, because that got settled pretty quickly.
0:07:40.180.180	0:07:40.440.439	Oh, gotcha.
0:07:41.120.120	0:07:46.160.160	And yeah, that Diddy's basically just at the top of a gang, and the person that's above
0:07:46.160.160	0:07:47.780.779	him is Lucien Grange, which is just wild.
0:07:48.060.060	0:07:48.340.339	Okay.
0:07:48.580.579	0:07:48.760.759	Yeah.
0:07:48.760.759	0:07:49.380.379	What do you think?
0:07:49.700.699	0:07:53.460.459	You made a mention that this might be an indicator to things that have happened with black
0:07:53.460.459	0:07:53.880.879	culture.
0:07:54.160.160	0:07:55.440.439	What do you mean by that, I guess?
0:07:55.740.740	0:08:00.900.899	So, there has been just a very obvious corrosion in black culture.
0:08:00.980.980	0:08:04.600.600	Like, the music that I grew up in, I was listening to The Temptations, Lauryn Hill, like, it was
0:08:04.600.600	0:08:06.100.100	all about, like, family, love.
0:08:06.180.180	0:08.000	It was real talent.
0:08:07.580.579	0:08:13.660.660	And then something just really shifted, and it all became about derogatory, debased,
0:08:13.920.920	0:08:14.960.959	gangster rap.
0:08:14.960.959	0:08:19.200.199	And it's just a change that I've noted in a lot of my commentary, and, you know, I think
0:08:19.200.199	0:08:26.960.959	other people have, like, I asked the question, there's a really, in my view, disgusting artist,
0:08:27.420.420	0:08:31.340.339	just in terms of the stuff that she publishes and the photos that she publishes, named Sexy
0:08:31.340.339	0:08:34.200.200	Red, who they're now making a thing, right?
0:08:34.920.919	0:08:36.620.620	Who makes the decision to sign a Sexy Red?
0:08:36.620.620	0:08:41.440.440	You're telling me you have all the money and all the talent at your fingertips, and you
0:08:41.440.440	0:08:47.920.919	sign a woman who, at her baby shower, nine months pregnant, however pregnant she was, was
0:08:47.920.919	0:08:53.100.100	twerking, and had her butt cheeks in, like, somebody's face was inside of her butt cheeks.
0:08:53.460.460	0:08:54.760.759	That, to me, is very intentional.
0:08:54.840.840	0:08:56.480.480	Because you're not signing her based on talent.
0:08:56.600.600	0:08:58.040.039	You're not signing her based on following.
0:08:58.420.419	0:09:00.600.600	You're signing her because it's filth.
0:09:00.980.980	0:09:04.380.379	And you're perpetuating this filth into my community.
0:09:04.380.379	0:09:08.200.200	So, I, yeah, I've just, it's just something that I've noticed, something that I talk about
0:09:08.200.200	0:09:13.140.139	often, that are, we're intentionally being sold crack, it feels like, you know.
0:09:14.180.179	0:09:17.990.990	So, I'm trying to think of which direction I want to go.
0:09:18.790.789	0:09:19.770.769	Any direction you want.
0:09:19.850.850	0:09:20.530.529	I'm an open book.
0:09:20.750.750	0:09:21.330.330	Yeah, you're fine.
0:09:21.530.529	0:09:24.370.370	There are, there are, okay, so there are, like, two kind of different ways of viewing
0:09:24.370.370	0:09:24.730.730	this.
0:09:25.410.409	0:09:27.630.629	And I feel like you fall more to one side than I'll go to my side, and then we can kind
0:09:27.630.629	0:09:30.970.970	of see if we can iron out or figure where we are at, I guess, in the middle here.
0:09:30.970.970	0:09:37.030.029	Um, I feel like when you look at the evolution of, when we say, like, degenerate black culture
0:09:37.030.029	0:09:41.390.389	or degenerate black music, I think we're generally talking about, like, the beginning of hip-hop
0:09:41.390.389	0:09:45.050.049	and rap, and then kind of the evolution of that going forward, coming away from, like,
0:09:45.190.190	0:09:47.970.970	the R&B singers and everybody, like, in the 50s, 60s, 70s, whatever, right?
0:09:48.110.110	0:09:48.270.269	Yeah.
0:09:48.370.370	0:09:48.710.710	Um.
0:09:48.910.909	0:09:50.370.370	But hip-hop isn't always filth.
0:09:50.610.610	0:09:51.550.549	But, yeah, I get your point.
0:09:51.570.570	0:09:52.770.769	Yeah, but that seems like the general, yeah.
0:09:52.770.769	0:09:58.390.389	Um, it feels like when I, when I look at music or if I look at music that, um, people
0:09:58.390.389	0:10:01.090.090	create, oftentimes the music is a reflection of their circumstances.
0:10:01.570.570	0:10:06.910.909	And you can see, uh, especially as America and the black communities became more conscientious,
0:10:06.970.970	0:10:10.850.850	maybe, of the ghettos that they'd been kind of pushed into or the policing situations
0:10:10.850.850	0:10:14.330.330	that they'd had to be a part of or drugs destroying their communities, et cetera, et cetera.
0:10:14.630.629	0:10:18.510.509	Um, and then those people turning to crime, that you also see the music and the art kind
0:10:18.510.509	0:10:23.590.590	of reflect those conditions and then those pieces of art that get, that get created,
0:10:23.690.690	0:10:26.050.049	especially the music, end up being, like, worldwide popular.
0:10:26.230.230	0:10:29.670.669	Like, the most popular genre of music in the, in the world is, like, hip-hop and rap.
0:10:30.190.190	0:10:34.570.570	So, when I, when I look at people pushing certain stuff today, I'm like, okay, well,
0:10:35.270.269	0:10:38.630.629	um, we got two really big, in my opinion, uh, I went to school for music.
0:10:38.730.730	0:10:39.670.669	I don't know if you thought about the saxophone or whatever.
0:10:39.810.809	0:10:42.610.610	So, we had two really big contributions to the world of music from America.
0:10:42.610.610	0:10:45.870.870	One was jazz, um, that came basically from the black community.
0:10:45.950.950	0:10:47.190.190	And then the second was, like, rap and hip-hop.
0:10:47.190.190	0:10:50.130.129	Um, these forms of music become popular.
0:10:50.310.309	0:10:51.270.269	People see that it's popular.
0:10:51.410.409	0:10:52.130.129	They want to get involved.
0:10:52.230.230	0:10:55.170.169	Obviously, the money men, the people on top, they want to kind of continue to push this
0:10:55.170.169	0:10:57.350.350	because it's popular and everybody around the world consumes it.
0:10:57.790.789	0:11:02.370.370	I feel like there are a lot of market forces at work that kind of perpetuate this and keep
0:11:02.370.370	0:11:02.830.830	this happening.
0:11:03.210.210	0:11:06.110.110	And that feels pretty satisfying to me to explain what's going on.
0:11:06.130.129	0:11:09.410.409	So, when we ask, like, why is it a woman, uh, twerking with somebody's face and her
0:11:09.410.409	0:11:09.690.690	butt shakes?
0:11:09.770.769	0:11:12.510.509	Because, well, for whatever reason, that's, like, what the worldwide culture seems to want
0:11:12.510.509	0:11:13.050.049	to see right now.
0:11:13.050.049	0:11:16.430.429	And then on the other side, um, it feels like from people,
0:11:16.430.429	0:11:20.770.769	I don't want to just say conservatives, but I would say broadly speaking, um, I guess I'll
0:11:20.770.769	0:11:24.290.289	say on your side in general, it feels like there's this idea that there's this much more
0:11:24.290.289	0:11:27.390.389	intentional or, like, malevolent force working behind the scenes.
0:11:27.390.389	0:11:27.890.889	Yes, there is.
0:11:27.990.990	0:11:31.910.909	And so, I'm going to push back on what you're suggesting here.
0:11:31.970.970	0:11:37.550.549	You're suggesting that this reflects the community and they're sharing their stories in a way that
0:11:37.550.549	0:11:38.230.230	makes sense.
0:11:38.670.669	0:11:40.750.750	That's completely not true.
0:11:41.030.029	0:11:45.130.129	Okay, WAP does not reflect the circumstances that black people are living in, you know,
0:11:45.130.129	0:11:49.370.370	singing about your vagina and how hard it's getting pounded is not the circumstance of
0:11:49.370.370	0:11:50.090.090	living in the hood.
0:11:50.370.370	0:11:51.230.230	I come from nothing.
0:11:51.230.230	0:11:56.190.190	It's not that, that did not make me feel closer to the circumstances that I grew up in.
0:11:56.190.190	0:11:59.490.490	And unfortunately, that's actually what people are telling black Americans.
0:11:59.490.490	0:12:00.990.990	Like, actually, it's working the other way.
0:12:01.230.230	0:12:04.970.970	You're putting something, you know, your eyes and your ears are the windows to the soul.
0:12:05.510.509	0:12:10.510.509	And you're basically, when you celebrate someone, and I'm using Cardi B here as an example because
0:12:10.510.509	0:12:13.230.230	I think people are probably more familiar with her than they are with Sexy Red.
0:12:13.890.889	0:12:18.390.389	When you put someone like that on the Grammy stage, which is, again, a decision being made.
0:12:18.390.389	0:12:22.230.230	When I was growing up, the best, most talented people were on the Grammy stage.
0:12:22.430.429	0:12:23.850.850	It was something you could watch with your family.
0:12:24.650.649	0:12:25.790.789	And we still had poor people.
0:12:25.930.929	0:12:28.790.789	You still had, yeah, you still had poor people.
0:12:28.950.950	0:12:30.190.190	You still had people that were living in the hood.
0:12:30.350.350	0:12:36.790.789	Okay, we didn't need somebody talking about their vagina in order to feel seen.
0:12:37.330.330	0:12:43.610.610	So what you're doing is you're setting the stage for younger girls who aspire to celebrities
0:12:43.610.610	0:12:47.890.889	to say, okay, well, if I mimic that behavior, I too can become famous.
0:12:47.890.889	0:12:52.210.210	What you're actually doing is you're setting the idols that people are going to look up
0:12:52.210.210	0:12:54.970.970	to, and people are going to think, this is what I should aspire to.
0:12:55.550.549	0:12:58.330.330	So it's actually working in the exact opposite way.
0:12:58.530.529	0:12:59.370.370	Can I ask a question?
0:12:59.750.750	0:13:05.690.690	In that evolution of things, so if we look at WAP in particular, hasn't it generally been
0:13:05.690.690	0:13:09.950.950	the case that music is always kind of pushing these sexual boundaries?
0:13:09.950.950	0:13:13.190.190	So it might have been Elvis grabbing his crotch and dancing.
0:13:13.510.509	0:13:17.490.490	It might have been Michael Jackson's dancing is incredibly suggestive, if you've seen that.
0:13:17.870.870	0:13:21.510.509	It might have been in Woodstock, all the loser hippies talking about love, sex, and rock
0:13:21.510.509	0:13:22.290.289	and roll, and drugs.
0:13:23.110.110	0:13:26.770.769	Wouldn't like WAP just be kind of like the next evolution in a long chain of-
0:13:26.770.769	0:13:29.050.049	No, pushing boundaries is not degeneracy, okay?
0:13:29.270.269	0:13:30.230.230	And so here's what I'll say to you.
0:13:30.230.230	0:13:33.110.110	Why don't you pull up the lyrics to WAP and read them right now?
0:13:33.810.809	0:13:34.730.730	Well, I don't-
0:13:34.730.730	0:13:35.350.350	Why would I need to do that?
0:13:35.350.350	0:13:35.990.990	No, it's just Woodstock.
0:13:36.090.090	0:13:38.390.389	We're just pushing the boundaries a little bit.
0:13:38.750.750	0:13:41.890.889	You probably have never even read the lyrics to WAP.
0:13:42.270.269	0:13:44.670.669	I think I did, because I think Ben Shapiro had a huge thing about it.
0:13:44.690.690	0:13:45.710.710	No, he couldn't have said-
0:13:45.710.710	0:13:51.050.049	You may have seen him reading the sanitized version of WAP, not the one that is not sanitized.
0:13:51.050.049	0:13:55.270.269	The sanitized one, which is still bad, that she can perform at the Grammys, is what he read.
0:13:55.490.490	0:14:05.210.210	You should read the lyrics to WAP before you make commentary that it's a reflection of what black Americans are living through,
0:14:05.350.350	0:14:07.250.250	or it's just somebody that's pushing a boundary.
0:14:07.390.389	0:14:07.910.909	It's not that.
0:14:08.010.009	0:14:11.630.629	How do you explain the fact that WAP was a number one worldwide hit then?
0:14:11.650.649	0:14:16.210.210	Because what I said to you is that they are artificially creating artists at this point.
0:14:16.550.549	0:14:17.350.350	There's no question.
0:14:17.350.350	0:14:20.550.549	And by the way, the Diddy Docs, which I found to be a very compelling point,
0:14:20.550.549	0:14:25.430.429	was that Diddy said to the guy, allegedly, who was the producer,
0:14:25.630.629	0:14:29.010.009	that if he was willing to engage in homosexual behavior with him,
0:14:29.370.370	0:14:31.970.970	that he would get him producer of the year Grammy.
0:14:32.910.909	0:14:34.110.110	So what does that tell you?
0:14:34.190.190	0:14:37.170.169	It means that the entire system is artificial.
0:14:37.390.389	0:14:40.790.789	And by the way, this is something that Kanye said 10 years ago,
0:14:40.790.789	0:14:45.030.029	or however long ago it was, when he took the trophy from Taylor Swift,
0:14:45.270.269	0:14:47.030.029	and said, this is all fake.
0:14:47.070.070	0:14:48.530.529	This is not even based on merit anymore.
0:14:48.690.690	0:14:49.450.450	And that is my point.
0:14:49.450.450	0:14:51.050.049	The industry is not based on merit.
0:14:51.110.110	0:14:52.290.289	It's not based on capitalism.
0:14:52.290.289	0:14:54.050.049	It is based on selling ideas.
0:14:54.410.409	0:14:58.270.269	So it is, who do we want to artificially make the person
0:14:58.270.269	0:15:01.970.970	that every black girl will look up to, or who they will aspire to?
0:15:02.690.690	0:15:06.550.549	So I can definitely understand that maybe award shows can be rigged,
0:15:06.550.549	0:15:10.390.389	or people can think different things about who's being awarded based on merit
0:15:10.390.389	0:15:11.510.509	for the Grammys, or something like that.
0:15:11.510.509	0:15:15.210.210	But WAP was genuinely, do you think it wasn't genuinely a popular song,
0:15:15.250.250	0:15:19.190.190	or do you think that music execs have the ability to manufacture that desire publicly?
0:15:19.950.950	0:15:20.330.330	The latter.
0:15:20.990.990	0:15:24.950.950	So if you start playing something tons of times on the airways, the latter.
0:15:25.070.070	0:15:26.170.169	You can definitely make something popular.
0:15:26.230.230	0:15:28.870.870	There are songs that I don't even like that I've heard so much
0:15:28.870.870	0:15:30.570.570	that I know every single lyric to.
0:15:30.630.629	0:15:33.070.070	And I'm like, I don't even know how I know every single lyric to the song,
0:15:33.070.070	0:15:35.290.289	but it's just been, it's received this many plays.
0:15:35.410.409	0:15:36.090.090	You put it everywhere.
0:15:36.430.429	0:15:37.370.370	You award the person.
0:15:37.490.490	0:15:38.910.909	You invite them to bizarre circumstances.
0:15:39.030.029	0:15:42.110.110	Like, there's absolutely no reason that Cardi B is invited to sit down
0:15:42.110.110	0:15:43.350.350	and ask questions to Joe Biden.
0:15:43.590.590	0:15:45.110.110	So I can kind of...
0:15:45.110.110	0:15:48.150.149	Unless you are really making an effort to legitimatize this person
0:15:48.150.149	0:15:49.470.470	and to make this person aspirational.
0:15:49.590.590	0:15:51.030.029	Again, this is not an insult to Cardi.
0:15:51.210.210	0:15:54.570.570	I actually think that personality-wise, she's got a ton of talent,
0:15:54.570.570	0:15:58.750.750	and she's interesting, and I've said great things about her on Love and Hip Hop,
0:15:58.750.750	0:16:00.790.789	and there are elements of her that make her a star.
0:16:00.790.789	0:16:04.230.230	But what I am saying is that a lot of that is manufactured,
0:16:04.650.649	0:16:09.230.230	and I just don't see how anybody, when looking at...
0:16:09.230.230	0:16:11.830.830	Don't you think it's entirely possible or easily possible?
0:16:11.930.929	0:16:13.610.610	So I feel like there's so many things wrong with this.
0:16:13.650.649	0:16:18.330.330	So one is, why wouldn't competing record labels start pushing talent
0:16:18.330.330	0:16:20.030.029	that's actually popular that people want to hear?
0:16:20.150.149	0:16:21.090.090	I think that would be a big question.
0:16:21.170.169	0:16:24.150.149	The second thing would be, how can we explain the top-down domination
0:16:24.150.149	0:16:29.010.009	of this type of media popularity through all of our reality TV shows,
0:16:29.010.009	0:16:31.910.909	all of our TikTok stuff, all of our YouTube videos, and the music industry,
0:16:31.990.990	0:16:34.450.450	and then how can you explain that all happening worldwide?
0:16:34.650.649	0:16:34.890.889	Sure.
0:16:35.010.009	0:16:40.390.389	It feels like to try to explain this through people that are exercising control
0:16:40.390.389	0:16:43.090.090	on these platforms would require more control than anybody has ever been able
0:16:43.090.090	0:16:45.710.710	to exercise on any platform ever, and they're doing it in a multi-country,
0:16:45.790.789	0:16:46.450.450	multi-stage level.
0:16:46.450.450	0:16:48.090.090	It's just called, it's very easy, actually.
0:16:48.170.169	0:16:50.810.809	It's a very basic concept pertaining to governments.
0:16:51.050.049	0:16:51.790.789	They need propaganda.
0:16:52.310.309	0:16:53.090.090	Hollywood is propaganda.
0:16:53.590.590	0:16:55.930.929	You should, for those of you that are watching this live,
0:16:56.170.169	0:17:00.730.730	go listen to the conversation that Joe Rogan had with Cat Williams,
0:17:00.930.929	0:17:03.730.730	where he talked about all of this, and he said,
0:17:03.910.909	0:17:05.610.609	I know you think that you're being entertained,
0:17:05.830.829	0:17:08.050.049	and this is somebody that comes from inside of the industry,
0:17:08.050.049	0:17:11.970.970	and he starts talking about the ditty stuff,
0:17:12.110.109	0:17:14.750.750	the idea that in order to climb higher,
0:17:14.910.910	0:17:17.910.910	you kind of have to engage in nefarious behavior,
0:17:18.450.450	0:17:20.950.950	and how he was collecting all of this information,
0:17:21.110.109	0:17:23.350.349	and he was speaking out about what was happening inside of the industry,
0:17:23.350.349	0:17:25.810.809	and he said, it is twofold.
0:17:25.910.910	0:17:26.970.970	You might be being entertained,
0:17:27.210.210	0:17:29.450.450	but they are making decisions about what will entertain you,
0:17:29.710.710	0:17:33.110.109	and a great circumstance in which he presented that is evidence of that
0:17:33.110.109	0:17:36.930.930	is transgenderism, and he asked a question, hold on, hold on.
0:17:37.490.490	0:17:39.850.849	He asked a question, which should be answered.
0:17:40.470.470	0:17:42.230.230	He said to Joe Rogan, and he laughed about it.
0:17:42.250.250	0:17:45.170.170	He was like, a guy wears a dress on the red carpet, okay,
0:17:45.350.349	0:17:48.250.250	and then the media tells you how great he wore the dress,
0:17:48.250.250	0:17:51.150.150	and he's like, if, he said, tell me one situation
0:17:51.150.150	0:17:53.190.190	where he didn't wear the dress wonderfully,
0:17:53.390.390	0:17:55.530.529	when he didn't wear the dress in a way that was amazing.
0:17:55.530.529	0:17:58.350.349	It's because they have all agreed that this is the narrative,
0:17:58.650.650	0:18:01.050.049	and then he talked about the fact that the record execs
0:18:01.050.049	0:18:04.670.670	also own the publications that are saying that something is amazing
0:18:04.670.670	0:18:05.850.849	or something is not amazing,
0:18:05.850.849	0:18:08.870.869	and that is just plain old-fashioned propaganda,
0:18:09.150.150	0:18:12.830.829	so you don't necessarily need to detach what we're talking about
0:18:12.830.829	0:18:15.850.849	from your concept of what governments are interested in.
0:18:16.170.170	0:18:17.330.329	It's always propaganda.
0:18:18.010.009	0:18:20.610.609	So, I understand Cat Williams has said this.
0:18:21.070.069	0:18:23.610.609	I was going to say that Cat Williams was at one point in his life
0:18:23.610.609	0:18:25.550.549	addicted to crack, and I think he's famous for losing a fight
0:18:25.550.549	0:18:26.250.250	to a high school kid.
0:18:26.630.630	0:18:28.250.250	I think this benched his career for a while.
0:18:28.410.410	0:18:29.870.869	You can insult him, but it doesn't mean it this morning.
0:18:29.870.869	0:18:30.610.609	I'm not insulting him.
0:18:30.610.609	0:18:32.750.750	He says 2 plus 2 equals 4, 2 plus 2 equals 4.
0:18:32.810.809	0:18:33.550.549	I'm not insulting him.
0:18:33.550.549	0:18:35.570.569	I'm just saying that to, like, lean into his testimony,
0:18:35.730.730	0:18:37.810.809	who also, we would both acknowledge, has a lot to gain
0:18:37.810.809	0:18:40.130.130	by giving, like, incredulous testimony like this,
0:18:40.170.170	0:18:42.010.009	like, saying, like, oh, my God, these crazy things are happening.
0:18:42.590.589	0:18:44.710.710	I don't know if I would just say, well, right, he does.
0:18:44.830.829	0:18:46.650.650	The fact that you're talking about him, and you're citing him,
0:18:46.690.690	0:18:48.550.549	and you know it, right, if anybody else was saying a similar thing,
0:18:48.570.569	0:18:50.270.269	we'd say, well, okay, they're saying this
0:18:50.270.269	0:18:51.730.730	because they have something to gain for it, right?
0:18:51.730.730	0:18:53.190.190	He knows that this is going to be a hot take,
0:18:53.210.210	0:18:54.910.910	and he knows that it's going to go viral if he says it,
0:18:54.930.930	0:18:56.330.329	and he knows he's going to get a lot of eyes on him for it.
0:18:56.570.569	0:18:58.490.490	So I think it's good to call that into question.
0:18:59.170.170	0:19:02.810.809	I think the issue that I have when it comes to the accusation
0:19:02.810.809	0:19:04.450.450	that everything is some top-down level propaganda
0:19:04.450.450	0:19:06.850.849	is I feel like the conversation shifts away
0:19:06.850.849	0:19:08.650.650	from the important stuff, which is
0:19:08.650.650	0:19:10.630.630	why are people attracted to this type of stuff?
0:19:10.730.730	0:19:11.890.890	Why do people vibe with it so much?
0:19:11.930.930	0:19:14.390.390	Why are we replacing traditional better forms of media
0:19:14.390.390	0:19:16.430.430	or more thought-provoking, I don't know what you would call it,
0:19:16.430.430	0:19:17.750.750	forms of media, with this type of stuff?
0:19:17.750.750	0:19:19.890.890	Instead of having conversations about the culture and the society,
0:19:19.890.890	0:19:22.530.529	it's all fixated on some weird top-down plot
0:19:22.530.529	0:19:24.490.490	to control media consumption.
0:19:24.710.710	0:19:26.550.549	I think you just like to be contrarian,
0:19:26.810.809	0:19:29.030.029	because I don't understand the point that you're making here.
0:19:29.110.109	0:19:29.750.750	Of course-
0:19:29.750.750	0:19:30.290.289	Wait, hold on, wait, wait.
0:19:30.310.309	0:19:31.210.210	Let me restate that.
0:19:31.250.250	0:19:31.490.490	I'm sorry.
0:19:31.550.549	0:19:32.770.769	The point I'm making is very clear.
0:19:33.230.230	0:19:35.170.170	If I was going to-
0:19:35.170.170	0:19:38.190.190	I've got an almost 13-year-old son in a few days, okay?
0:19:38.490.490	0:19:40.470.470	If I was to see that he's consuming media,
0:19:40.790.789	0:19:42.090.089	my go-to would be like,
0:19:42.090.089	0:19:44.230.230	hey, Nathan, why are you watching this?
0:19:44.430.430	0:19:45.030.029	This is crazy.
0:19:45.290.289	0:19:46.410.410	We need to look at something else.
0:19:46.530.529	0:19:46.890.890	I need to-
0:19:46.890.890	0:19:47.550.549	Who are your friends?
0:19:47.810.809	0:19:48.570.569	What are you looking at online?
0:19:48.570.569	0:19:50.250.250	We need to change your media consumption habits,
0:19:50.310.309	0:19:51.110.109	because this isn't working.
0:19:51.370.369	0:19:52.170.170	I would never think like,
0:19:52.350.349	0:19:53.750.750	I think that the school is involved
0:19:53.750.750	0:19:55.250.250	in disseminating media towards him,
0:19:55.290.289	0:19:56.430.430	and there's no way that we can change this,
0:19:56.470.470	0:19:58.750.750	because I feel like on your side of the story,
0:19:58.990.990	0:19:59.810.809	people are basically like,
0:20:00.170.170	0:20:01.270.269	we're hopeless.
0:20:01.450.450	0:20:02.130.130	There's nothing we can do.
0:20:02.190.190	0:20:03.030.029	No, it's not hopeless,
0:20:03.270.269	0:20:05.710.710	but if you want to be able to do something about something,
0:20:05.790.789	0:20:07.950.950	you need to be able to acknowledge the something, right?
0:20:08.050.049	0:20:09.370.369	What would the things that we do about it?
0:20:09.370.369	0:20:10.190.190	It's a conspiracy.
0:20:10.310.309	0:20:11.650.650	It's like, no, when I graduated high school,
0:20:11.650.650	0:20:12.690.690	there wasn't a single trans kid.
0:20:13.170.170	0:20:15.530.529	Now you've got like more than 50% of kids
0:20:15.530.529	0:20:16.370.369	that think that they're other,
0:20:16.490.490	0:20:18.150.150	that that is obviously propaganda,
0:20:18.150.150	0:20:18.570.569	clearly.
0:20:18.790.789	0:20:19.070.069	There's just no,
0:20:19.090.089	0:20:20.870.869	it's just not possible that you didn't exist.
0:20:20.990.990	0:20:22.050.049	Maybe there was one person,
0:20:22.430.430	0:20:23.770.769	and then all of a sudden everyone is.
0:20:23.930.930	0:20:24.770.769	Sure, I think it's okay to draw the line.
0:20:24.770.769	0:20:25.350.349	That can only happen,
0:20:25.370.369	0:20:27.770.769	that can only happen through propaganda, right?
0:20:27.810.809	0:20:28.270.269	Maybe others.
0:20:28.270.269	0:20:29.430.430	They're suddenly being told an option.
0:20:29.870.869	0:20:30.770.769	They're kids, right?
0:20:30.830.829	0:20:31.790.789	You want to experiment,
0:20:31.930.930	0:20:32.670.670	and you want to be different.
0:20:32.750.750	0:20:34.010.009	You're looking for a way to stand out,
0:20:34.190.190	0:20:35.190.190	and so you hold on,
0:20:35.270.269	0:20:36.050.049	and in the classrooms,
0:20:36.150.150	0:20:37.390.390	you've got teachers
0:20:37.390.390	0:20:39.030.029	that are reinforcing this narrative,
0:20:39.110.109	0:20:39.870.869	this narrative that is,
0:20:40.010.009	0:20:41.090.089	yes, top down, right?
0:20:41.090.089	0:20:42.850.849	It's like Hollywood in lockstep
0:20:42.850.849	0:20:43.930.930	with the Department of Education
0:20:43.930.930	0:20:45.650.650	that is making these options available.
0:20:46.050.049	0:20:46.790.789	If it was natural,
0:20:46.850.849	0:20:47.730.730	when I graduated high school,
0:20:48.050.049	0:20:48.730.730	there were gay kids.
0:20:49.170.170	0:20:49.770.769	There were lesbian kids.
0:20:49.790.789	0:20:50.530.529	There wasn't a ton of them.
0:20:50.590.589	0:20:51.230.230	It wasn't an identity.
0:20:51.390.390	0:20:51.930.930	That's another thing.
0:20:52.010.009	0:20:53.150.150	The identity thing is very new.
0:20:53.150.150	0:20:54.730.730	Yeah, the identity is an interesting thing.
0:20:54.770.769	0:20:55.430.430	I agree, for sure.
0:20:55.510.509	0:20:56.390.390	And so it shows you,
0:20:56.530.529	0:20:57.310.309	who are they emulating?
0:20:57.470.470	0:20:58.530.529	Who are they copying
0:20:58.530.529	0:20:59.590.589	when they do this stuff?
0:20:59.950.950	0:21:00.770.769	Because it's an option.
0:21:00.850.849	0:21:02.010.009	It's just being presented to you.
0:21:02.070.069	0:21:03.670.670	It's obviously not natural
0:21:03.670.670	0:21:05.610.609	if it didn't exist naturally.
0:21:05.890.890	0:21:06.270.269	I agree,
0:21:06.390.390	0:21:08.190.190	but culture is a very complicated thing.
0:21:08.190.190	0:21:09.350.349	Culture is not a complicated thing.
0:21:09.370.369	0:21:09.730.730	Movies are so complicated.
0:21:09.730.730	0:21:10.870.869	I think governments pray
0:21:10.870.869	0:21:12.090.089	that they have the amount
0:21:12.090.089	0:21:13.090.089	of control over culture
0:21:13.090.089	0:21:13.950.950	that you think they do.
0:21:14.030.029	0:21:14.790.789	There's no shot
0:21:14.790.789	0:21:15.490.490	that anybody would be able
0:21:15.490.490	0:21:16.550.549	to top down control
0:21:16.550.549	0:21:17.610.609	that much stuff.
0:21:17.730.730	0:21:18.330.329	Well, like I said,
0:21:18.430.430	0:21:21.690.690	there have been a lot of evidence
0:21:21.690.690	0:21:22.310.309	that has come out,
0:21:22.350.349	0:21:22.690.690	whether you're looking
0:21:22.690.690	0:21:23.650.650	at the Jeffrey Epstein case
0:21:23.650.650	0:21:24.610.609	or you're reading through
0:21:24.610.609	0:21:26.250.250	the 72-page document
0:21:26.250.250	0:21:27.870.869	for the Diddy lawsuit
0:21:27.870.869	0:21:29.350.349	that suggests that the government
0:21:29.350.349	0:21:30.230.230	is involved.
0:21:30.370.369	0:21:31.510.509	Even on the Jeffrey Epstein case,
0:21:31.610.609	0:21:32.410.410	what's suggesting
0:21:32.410.410	0:21:33.410.410	government involvement here?
0:21:34.150.150	0:21:34.670.670	What do you mean?
0:21:34.670.670	0:21:36.170.170	What do you mean
0:21:36.170.170	0:21:36.790.789	what's suggesting government involvement?
0:21:36.790.789	0:21:38.050.049	What part of the Jeffrey Epstein case
0:21:38.050.049	0:21:38.710.710	is like, oh my God,
0:21:38.750.750	0:21:40.290.289	the government is playing a part in this?
0:21:40.750.750	0:21:43.130.130	Well, the fact that he had ties
0:21:43.130.130	0:21:45.210.210	to the Mossad and the CIA
0:21:45.210.210	0:21:46.990.990	and that when they raided his home,
0:21:47.450.450	0:21:48.530.529	he had his face
0:21:48.530.529	0:21:49.450.450	and about, what was it,
0:21:49.510.509	0:21:50.470.470	six different passports?
0:21:50.630.630	0:21:51.670.670	Who can issue passports?
0:21:51.990.990	0:21:52.930.930	Sure, but when we look at it...
0:21:52.930.930	0:21:53.690.690	Who can issue you
0:21:53.690.690	0:21:54.430.430	a different identity
0:21:54.430.430	0:21:55.150.150	in different countries?
0:21:55.150.150	0:21:55.570.569	I don't know about
0:21:55.570.569	0:21:56.230.230	different identities,
0:21:56.370.369	0:21:57.070.069	but for passports,
0:21:57.130.130	0:21:58.170.170	I imagine you can get that illegally
0:21:58.170.170	0:21:58.770.769	or you can just get it
0:21:58.770.769	0:21:59.190.190	from countries
0:21:59.190.190	0:22:00.450.450	depending on citizenship status.
0:22:00.710.710	0:22:02.010.009	But what I'm saying is that
0:22:02.010.009	0:22:03.250.250	for when we look at Epstein,
0:22:03.370.369	0:22:04.270.269	Epstein was a billionaire,
0:22:04.270.269	0:22:04.730.730	right?
0:22:05.190.190	0:22:05.870.869	Why was he a billionaire?
0:22:06.490.490	0:22:06.650.650	Why?
0:22:06.950.950	0:22:07.970.970	Because of trading
0:22:07.970.970	0:22:08.490.490	or whatever he did?
0:22:08.530.529	0:22:09.070.069	I'm not really sure.
0:22:09.290.289	0:22:09.970.970	No, that's the question.
0:22:10.150.150	0:22:10.930.930	Nobody knows why
0:22:10.930.930	0:22:11.770.769	I don't know why
0:22:11.770.769	0:22:13.270.269	there's like a million dollars.
0:22:13.510.509	0:22:14.370.369	Sure, there's lots of people
0:22:14.370.369	0:22:14.870.869	where I don't know
0:22:14.870.869	0:22:15.670.670	how they made their money,
0:22:15.770.769	0:22:16.830.829	but to fill in the gaps
0:22:16.830.829	0:22:17.390.390	of all of this
0:22:17.390.390	0:22:18.110.109	with some...
0:22:18.110.109	0:22:18.910.910	No, you should always know
0:22:18.910.910	0:22:19.790.789	how somebody became a billionaire.
0:22:20.050.049	0:22:21.070.069	That's like a very easy thing.
0:22:21.270.269	0:22:22.170.170	Somebody should just be like,
0:22:22.210.210	0:22:22.710.710	I became a billionaire
0:22:22.710.710	0:22:23.570.569	and you have no idea how.
0:22:23.690.690	0:22:24.710.710	I'm sure there are tons of people
0:22:24.710.710	0:22:25.210.210	who are billionaires that aren't...
0:22:25.210.210	0:22:25.790.789	It's like, I sold the product,
0:22:25.930.930	0:22:27.110.109	you know why Elon Musk has money,
0:22:27.190.190	0:22:28.730.730	you know why Jeff Bezos has money.
0:22:28.870.869	0:22:29.690.690	You should not say,
0:22:29.830.829	0:22:30.830.829	we can't connect the dots
0:22:30.830.829	0:22:31.550.549	on how this person
0:22:31.550.549	0:22:32.290.289	became a billionaire
0:22:32.290.289	0:22:33.210.210	that was able to purchase
0:22:33.210.210	0:22:33.470.470	the island.
0:22:33.470.470	0:22:34.070.069	The filings aren't always
0:22:34.070.069	0:22:34.790.789	going to be public
0:22:34.790.789	0:22:35.630.630	that like, oh, well,
0:22:35.650.650	0:22:36.410.410	I can figure out exactly
0:22:36.410.410	0:22:37.090.089	why this person became a billionaire.
0:22:37.170.170	0:22:37.470.470	If they don't work
0:22:37.470.470	0:22:38.430.430	in like public traded companies
0:22:38.430.430	0:22:38.730.730	or something,
0:22:38.830.829	0:22:39.490.490	how will you ever know?
0:22:39.570.569	0:22:39.890.890	There's no way
0:22:39.890.890	0:22:40.430.430	you're going to know that.
0:22:41.070.069	0:22:41.510.509	He did.
0:22:42.650.650	0:22:43.630.630	Then what's the question?
0:22:45.170.170	0:22:45.930.930	It's not a question.
0:22:46.070.069	0:22:47.870.869	It's just nobody understands
0:22:47.870.869	0:22:49.450.450	why Jeffrey Epstein
0:22:49.450.450	0:22:50.410.410	or his brother
0:22:50.410.410	0:22:51.690.690	have billions of dollars.
0:22:52.110.109	0:22:52.870.869	You just said,
0:22:53.270.269	0:22:54.810.809	did he have a ton of shares
0:22:54.810.809	0:22:55.730.730	in publicly traded companies?
0:22:57.290.289	0:22:57.950.950	What do you mean?
0:22:58.070.069	0:22:58.690.690	Did he have a ton of shares
0:22:58.690.690	0:22:59.410.410	and we ask for instance,
0:22:59.650.650	0:23:00.650.650	like, so here's a question.
0:23:00.750.750	0:23:01.510.509	Do you know how Jeff Bezos
0:23:01.510.509	0:23:01.970.970	made his money
0:23:01.970.970	0:23:02.550.549	or how Elon Musk
0:23:02.550.549	0:23:03.170.170	made his money?
0:23:04.030.029	0:23:06.030.029	I know that Jeff Bezos
0:23:06.030.029	0:23:06.830.829	created Amazon
0:23:06.830.829	0:23:08.730.730	and I know that Elon Musk
0:23:08.730.730	0:23:09.650.650	has created a ton of things.
0:23:09.710.710	0:23:10.670.670	Tesla, you've got Starlink.
0:23:10.670.670	0:23:11.250.250	Okay, kind of.
0:23:11.310.309	0:23:11.770.769	So not really.
0:23:11.970.970	0:23:12.810.809	Bezos made his money
0:23:12.810.809	0:23:13.630.630	because of the appreciation
0:23:13.630.630	0:23:14.350.349	of shares of Amazon
0:23:14.350.349	0:23:15.690.690	that he had a huge stake in, right?
0:23:15.770.769	0:23:16.770.769	And Elon Musk made
0:23:16.770.769	0:23:17.530.529	a lot of his money.
0:23:17.610.609	0:23:18.270.269	Initially it was on PayPal
0:23:18.270.269	0:23:19.030.029	and a couple of other ventures
0:23:19.030.029	0:23:19.750.750	and then because he had
0:23:19.750.750	0:23:20.610.609	a huge equity stake
0:23:20.610.609	0:23:23.210.210	in SpaceX and Tesla especially.
0:23:23.390.390	0:23:24.230.230	That's where they made their money
0:23:24.230.230	0:23:25.210.210	is ownership of stock
0:23:25.210.210	0:23:25.990.990	of publicly traded companies.
0:23:26.070.069	0:23:26.330.329	That's why I'm saying
0:23:26.330.329	0:23:26.950.950	we can look at those people
0:23:26.950.950	0:23:27.430.430	and say we know
0:23:28.690.690	0:23:30.110.109	I don't think Epstein had
0:23:30.110.109	0:23:31.070.069	massive shares
0:23:31.070.069	0:23:32.030.029	in publicly traded companies,
0:23:32.130.130	0:23:32.330.329	did he?
0:23:32.550.549	0:23:33.250.250	So he wouldn't have made it.
0:23:33.250.250	0:23:33.990.990	Did you actually look
0:23:33.990.990	0:23:34.610.609	into the Epstein case
0:23:34.610.609	0:23:35.090.089	or are you just,
0:23:35.170.170	0:23:36.130.130	because I can't tell right now
0:23:36.130.130	0:23:36.770.769	if your thing is just
0:23:36.770.769	0:23:37.590.589	to be contrarian.
0:23:37.830.829	0:23:38.570.569	Okay, hold on.
0:23:38.630.630	0:23:39.410.410	No, I'm being serious.
0:23:39.570.569	0:23:40.070.069	No, I'm asking you
0:23:40.070.069	0:23:40.650.650	because it seems like
0:23:40.650.650	0:23:41.050.049	you're just like
0:23:41.050.049	0:23:41.730.730	whatever your position is
0:23:41.730.730	0:23:42.210.210	I'm going to take the opposite
0:23:42.210.210	0:23:42.650.650	and I'm going to say
0:23:42.650.650	0:23:43.230.230	something really quickly
0:23:43.230.230	0:23:43.690.690	and try to say
0:23:43.690.690	0:23:44.130.130	well how do we know
0:23:44.130.130	0:23:44.950.950	and it's like
0:23:44.950.950	0:23:46.250.250	that's actually quite boring.
0:23:46.550.549	0:23:46.910.910	Sure, I understand.
0:23:46.910.910	0:23:47.270.269	You know what I mean?
0:23:47.350.349	0:23:47.890.890	Like it's like dude
0:23:47.890.890	0:23:48.970.970	like let's actually
0:23:48.970.970	0:23:49.490.490	have a real conversation
0:23:49.490.490	0:23:50.730.730	because tons of stuff
0:23:50.730.730	0:23:51.490.490	is happening right now.
0:23:51.590.589	0:23:52.070.069	A lot of stuff
0:23:52.070.069	0:23:53.290.289	is being exposed, right?
0:23:53.410.410	0:23:54.850.849	People are for the first time
0:23:54.850.849	0:23:56.350.349	able to grasp a theory
0:23:56.350.349	0:23:58.270.269	that finally makes sense, right?
0:23:58.290.289	0:23:58.930.930	It finally makes sense.
0:23:59.250.250	0:24:00.030.029	It makes sense
0:24:00.030.029	0:24:01.130.130	that there is a blackmail
0:24:01.130.130	0:24:02.610.609	operating in D.C.
0:24:02.710.710	0:24:03.830.829	because we don't understand
0:24:03.830.829	0:24:04.510.509	why we keep sending
0:24:04.510.509	0:24:05.950.950	our politicians to D.C.
0:24:06.070.069	0:24:06.890.890	and then it's like
0:24:06.890.890	0:24:08.230.230	they completely serve somebody,
0:24:08.470.470	0:24:09.290.289	anybody other than
0:24:09.290.289	0:24:10.610.609	the American people, right?
0:24:10.710.710	0:24:12.810.809	So when that Jeffrey Epstein case
0:24:12.810.809	0:24:13.290.289	got exposed
0:24:13.290.289	0:24:14.510.509	and if you were following it
0:24:14.510.509	0:24:14.970.970	and reading the documents.
0:24:14.970.970	0:24:15.490.490	I did follow it.
0:24:15.550.549	0:24:16.810.809	I read the entire document,
0:24:16.810.809	0:24:17.950.950	the 80 page report
0:24:17.950.950	0:24:18.710.710	that came out from the government.
0:24:18.830.829	0:24:19.770.769	Did a report on the prison
0:24:19.770.769	0:24:20.790.789	where he supposedly got killed
0:24:20.790.789	0:24:21.350.349	and you're realizing
0:24:21.350.349	0:24:22.270.269	how many artists
0:24:22.270.269	0:24:22.870.869	have stood up
0:24:22.870.869	0:24:24.350.349	and said this exact same thing
0:24:24.350.349	0:24:25.070.069	was going on.
0:24:25.370.369	0:24:26.090.089	Now you have somebody
0:24:26.090.089	0:24:26.990.990	that has filed something
0:24:26.990.990	0:24:27.850.849	with proof saying
0:24:27.850.849	0:24:28.430.430	it's going on
0:24:28.430.430	0:24:29.330.329	and then you just have
0:24:29.330.329	0:24:30.170.170	like a destiny being like,
0:24:30.230.230	0:24:31.110.109	oh, what if it's not going on?
0:24:31.210.210	0:24:31.590.589	What if it's not?
0:24:31.670.670	0:24:32.150.150	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
0:24:32.150.150	0:24:34.110.109	Oh, maybe WAP
0:24:34.110.109	0:24:35.050.049	is just really just that amazing.
0:24:35.150.150	0:24:35.590.589	People just love
0:24:35.590.589	0:24:36.410.410	talking about vaginas
0:24:36.410.410	0:24:37.150.150	and like mopping the floor.
0:24:37.210.210	0:24:39.070.069	It's like you can do that thing
0:24:39.070.069	0:24:40.290.289	but it's not interesting.
0:24:40.530.529	0:24:40.970.970	You know what I mean?
0:24:41.070.069	0:24:41.350.349	Okay, sure.
0:24:41.470.470	0:24:41.610.609	All right.
0:24:41.750.750	0:24:42.950.950	Here's just an easy test question
0:24:42.950.950	0:24:44.550.549	so I can get my bearings straight.
0:24:44.810.809	0:24:45.350.349	What do you think about
0:24:45.350.349	0:24:46.650.650	the 91 or so indictments
0:24:46.650.650	0:24:47.210.210	for Donald Trump?
0:24:48.010.009	0:24:48.430.430	What do you mean?
0:24:48.730.730	0:24:49.250.250	Do you think that those
0:24:49.250.250	0:24:49.970.970	are credible indictments
0:24:49.970.970	0:24:50.630.630	that have credible evidence
0:24:50.630.630	0:24:51.010.009	behind them?
0:24:51.170.170	0:24:52.150.150	Well, it speaks to me
0:24:52.150.150	0:24:52.850.849	specifically about
0:24:52.850.849	0:24:53.450.450	which indictment you're talking about.
0:24:53.450.450	0:24:55.330.329	So the Mar-a-Lago case.
0:24:55.430.430	0:24:56.650.650	I actually haven't followed that one
0:24:56.650.650	0:24:57.530.529	so I'm not going to push back
0:24:57.530.529	0:24:57.890.890	on that one
0:24:57.890.890	0:24:58.530.529	but I can tell you
0:24:58.530.529	0:24:59.490.490	the ones that I have followed
0:24:59.490.490	0:25:01.870.869	and I've given an answer on.
0:25:01.950.950	0:25:02.530.529	Like obviously
0:25:02.530.529	0:25:04.050.049	we've never seen
0:25:04.050.049	0:25:06.270.269	the media or the justice system
0:25:06.270.269	0:25:07.270.269	go after any president
0:25:07.270.269	0:25:08.090.089	in the way that they have.
0:25:08.090.089	0:25:08.310.309	That doesn't matter.
0:25:08.550.549	0:25:09.750.750	You could say the same about P. Diddy.
0:25:09.790.789	0:25:10.490.490	You've never seen the media
0:25:10.490.490	0:25:11.410.410	go after a black artist
0:25:11.410.410	0:25:11.970.970	like this.
0:25:12.290.289	0:25:14.110.109	I didn't finish my statement.
0:25:14.430.430	0:25:15.070.069	Why are you saying
0:25:15.070.069	0:25:15.490.490	it doesn't matter?
0:25:15.570.569	0:25:16.110.109	Why did you just say that?
0:25:16.110.109	0:25:17.310.309	It could be that
0:25:17.310.309	0:25:18.090.089	nobody's ever done something
0:25:18.090.089	0:25:19.350.349	this incredible before.
0:25:20.170.170	0:25:21.310.309	You're so contrarian
0:25:21.310.309	0:25:21.930.930	that you haven't even
0:25:21.930.930	0:25:22.290.289	let me finish.
0:25:22.310.309	0:25:23.310.309	Why do you keep calling me contrarian?
0:25:23.330.329	0:25:24.070.069	You haven't even let me
0:25:24.070.069	0:25:24.910.910	finish my sentence
0:25:24.910.910	0:25:25.570.569	and you said that doesn't matter.
0:25:25.650.650	0:25:26.370.369	It's like what do you
0:25:26.370.369	0:25:27.370.369	Because you gave a point
0:25:27.370.369	0:25:27.790.789	that was irrelevant.
0:25:27.870.869	0:25:28.290.289	I know but like
0:25:28.290.289	0:25:29.030.029	I don't understand
0:25:29.030.029	0:25:29.910.910	what you're objecting to.
0:25:30.310.309	0:25:31.730.730	You said the media
0:25:31.730.730	0:25:32.430.430	has never gone after
0:25:32.430.430	0:25:33.210.210	somebody like this before.
0:25:33.410.410	0:25:34.490.490	You asked me a question.
0:25:34.810.809	0:25:36.230.230	I started to answer it
0:25:36.230.230	0:25:37.230.230	by saying the media
0:25:37.230.230	0:25:38.510.509	has never gone after
0:25:38.510.509	0:25:39.930.930	anyone like this before.
0:25:40.510.509	0:25:41.490.490	And then you just said
0:25:41.490.490	0:25:42.190.190	it doesn't matter.
0:25:42.370.369	0:25:44.270.269	Can I answer the question?
0:25:44.270.269	0:25:46.090.089	Or you just gotta like
0:25:46.090.089	0:25:47.230.230	contradict right away.
0:25:47.230.230	0:25:48.170.170	I'm not contradicting.
0:25:48.330.329	0:25:49.290.289	I'm just fighting the crazy
0:25:49.290.289	0:25:50.150.150	narratives that prevent
0:25:50.150.150	0:25:51.150.150	anybody from having a real
0:25:51.150.150	0:25:51.830.829	analysis of any of the
0:25:51.830.829	0:25:52.310.309	things going on.
0:25:52.350.349	0:25:52.770.769	But you can lay out
0:25:52.770.769	0:25:53.330.329	your whole thing about
0:25:53.330.329	0:25:53.930.930	what you think about it.
0:25:53.930.930	0:25:55.210.210	Since you know my narrative
0:25:55.210.210	0:25:55.930.930	even though you asked the
0:25:55.930.930	0:25:56.830.829	question I wasn't able
0:25:56.830.829	0:25:57.630.630	to answer it.
0:25:57.690.690	0:25:58.410.410	You can answer the question.
0:25:58.410.410	0:25:58.970.970	I'm glad that you
0:25:58.970.970	0:26:00.070.069	defeat the narrative.
0:26:00.210.210	0:26:00.790.789	No we're good.
0:26:01.210.210	0:26:01.530.529	We're good.
0:26:01.810.809	0:26:02.510.509	I'm not going to have you
0:26:02.510.509	0:26:03.470.470	ask I'm not going to
0:26:03.470.470	0:26:04.870.869	actually have you ask a
0:26:04.870.869	0:26:06.330.329	question and then cut me
0:26:06.330.329	0:26:07.510.509	off and say that I'm
0:26:07.510.509	0:26:08.610.609	parroting a narrative when
0:26:08.610.609	0:26:10.270.269	I haven't even told you
0:26:10.270.269	0:26:11.110.109	what my opinion was.
0:26:11.490.490	0:26:12.710.710	That's not you being
0:26:12.710.710	0:26:13.710.710	interesting that's you being
0:26:13.710.710	0:26:14.510.509	obnoxious.
0:26:14.950.950	0:26:15.590.589	I think that you're trying
0:26:15.590.589	0:26:16.250.250	to avoid answering the
0:26:16.250.250	0:26:16.570.569	question.
0:26:17.330.329	0:26:18.530.529	By being cut off by you?
0:26:18.910.910	0:26:19.750.750	I said you could finish
0:26:19.750.750	0:26:20.270.269	it if you want.
0:26:20.610.609	0:26:21.830.829	You're trying to avoid
0:26:21.830.829	0:26:22.310.309	answering the question.
0:26:22.570.569	0:26:23.610.609	Quite literally I was trying
0:26:23.610.609	0:26:24.350.349	to answer the question
0:26:24.350.349	0:26:25.050.049	and you cut me off.
0:26:25.190.190	0:26:27.010.009	So we're good on that.
0:26:27.430.430	0:26:28.650.650	We can move on and talk
0:26:28.650.650	0:26:29.550.549	about something other
0:26:29.550.549	0:26:30.970.970	than Trump and his 95
0:26:30.970.970	0:26:31.810.809	indictments.
0:26:32.090.089	0:26:33.310.309	I think it's 91 or 92.
0:26:33.610.609	0:26:33.810.809	Okay.
0:26:35.790.789	0:26:36.790.789	Okay well what are we
0:26:36.790.789	0:26:37.290.289	talking about that won't
0:26:37.290.289	0:26:37.830.829	get you as triggered?
0:26:39.250.250	0:26:39.570.569	Okay.
0:26:40.430.430	0:26:42.690.690	I just honestly I like I
0:26:42.690.690	0:26:43.830.829	said to me again this I
0:26:43.830.829	0:26:45.130.130	said I am an open book.
0:26:45.470.470	0:26:46.670.670	I just I'm just curious
0:26:46.670.670	0:26:47.050.049	what you think about
0:26:47.050.049	0:26:47.670.670	the Trump indictments.
0:26:47.670.670	0:26:48.470.470	Do you think that a civil
0:26:48.470.470	0:26:49.970.970	suit that's filed where
0:26:49.970.970	0:26:50.930.930	there isn't a grand jury
0:26:50.930.930	0:26:51.590.589	that looks over it.
0:26:51.650.650	0:26:52.410.410	There's not like it's not
0:26:52.410.410	0:26:53.450.450	like a DA case not like
0:26:53.450.450	0:26:54.110.109	federal prosecute you think
0:26:54.110.109	0:26:55.270.269	that the Diddy stuff is
0:26:55.270.269	0:26:56.050.049	like rock solid.
0:26:56.130.130	0:26:56.690.690	You think that's really
0:26:56.690.690	0:26:57.430.430	really really important to
0:26:57.430.430	0:26:57.770.769	look at.
0:26:57.970.970	0:26:58.690.690	But then when we look at
0:26:58.690.690	0:26:59.490.490	indictments that have gone
0:26:59.490.490	0:27:00.870.869	to grand juries that have
0:27:00.870.869	0:27:02.210.210	then issued warrants or
0:27:02.210.210	0:27:03.390.390	subpoenas or whatever I was
0:27:03.390.390	0:27:03.930.930	just curious if you think
0:27:03.930.930	0:27:04.930.930	that the credibility on that
0:27:04.930.930	0:27:05.950.950	side is as heavy as the P.
0:27:06.010.009	0:27:06.390.390	Diddy stuff.
0:27:06.450.450	0:27:07.530.529	I was really happy to answer
0:27:07.530.529	0:27:07.750.750	that question.
0:27:07.750.750	0:27:08.570.569	Would you like me to answer it?
0:27:08.930.930	0:27:09.110.109	Sure.
0:27:09.270.269	0:27:10.730.730	So I would say that you are
0:27:10.730.730	0:27:12.310.309	comparing two cases that are
0:27:12.310.309	0:27:13.890.890	are not similar and I'll tell
0:27:13.890.890	0:27:14.890.890	you why they aren't similar.
0:27:15.450.450	0:27:17.010.009	In the case of Diddy you have
0:27:17.010.009	0:27:18.750.750	somebody that has no power
0:27:18.750.750	0:27:20.470.470	that is filing this and
0:27:20.470.470	0:27:21.890.890	producing evidence to say
0:27:21.890.890	0:27:24.170.170	that the justice essentially
0:27:24.170.170	0:27:25.790.789	the same thing that people
0:27:25.790.789	0:27:26.610.609	that defend Trump are saying
0:27:26.610.609	0:27:28.270.269	the justice system is corrupt
0:27:28.270.269	0:27:29.770.769	right that these people are
0:27:29.770.769	0:27:30.510.509	responding and being
0:27:30.510.509	0:27:32.070.069	motivated by things like the
0:27:32.070.069	0:27:33.990.990	LAPD's involvement that night
0:27:33.990.990	0:27:35.370.369	in writing a fake police
0:27:35.370.369	0:27:36.730.730	report if his allegations are
0:27:36.730.730	0:27:38.170.170	true and he had photos and
0:27:38.170.170	0:27:39.030.029	said that he was the person
0:27:39.030.029	0:27:40.690.690	that said call 9-1-1 and
0:27:40.690.690	0:27:42.210.210	then seeing the media report on
0:27:42.210.210	0:27:43.450.450	it and lie about what happened
0:27:43.450.450	0:27:45.170.170	at that studio is very scary.
0:27:45.170.170	0:27:47.410.410	It's scary if unless he faked
0:27:47.410.410	0:27:48.530.529	these blood photos which is
0:27:48.530.529	0:27:50.670.670	a plausibility but it shows you
0:27:50.670.670	0:27:52.410.410	that there are people that are
0:27:52.410.410	0:27:53.450.450	sitting at the top that have a
0:27:53.450.450	0:27:54.390.390	ton of power right.
0:27:54.790.789	0:27:56.170.170	So the people that are
0:27:56.170.170	0:27:57.910.910	acknowledging that and then
0:27:57.910.910	0:27:59.590.589	also saying that those same
0:27:59.590.589	0:28:01.350.349	people that that same network
0:28:01.350.349	0:28:03.410.410	of individuals that can make
0:28:03.410.410	0:28:05.110.109	up allegations and make them
0:28:05.110.109	0:28:06.950.950	go away with the media or
0:28:06.950.950	0:28:08.430.430	stay or and make it a big deal
0:28:08.430.430	0:28:09.970.970	because of the media are
0:28:09.970.970	0:28:11.370.369	defending Trump and what's
0:28:11.370.369	0:28:12.250.250	happening to him.
0:28:12.370.369	0:28:13.450.450	So this isn't they're actually
0:28:13.450.450	0:28:14.210.210	these two things are not a
0:28:14.210.210	0:28:15.010.009	conflict with one another
0:28:15.010.009	0:28:15.750.750	what's happening with Diddy
0:28:15.750.750	0:28:17.030.029	and what's happening with
0:28:17.030.029	0:28:17.290.289	Trump.
0:28:17.370.369	0:28:18.950.950	It's actually they compliment
0:28:18.950.950	0:28:19.970.970	one another in terms of what
0:28:19.970.970	0:28:20.490.490	we're saying.
0:28:21.130.130	0:28:23.830.829	Now the only case I've followed
0:28:23.830.829	0:28:26.770.769	two of them the Fannie
0:28:26.770.769	0:28:27.410.410	Willis one.
0:28:27.810.809	0:28:28.350.349	Well can I ask a question
0:28:28.350.349	0:28:29.210.210	about the LAPD thing?
0:28:29.350.349	0:28:29.490.490	Yeah.
0:28:29.730.730	0:28:31.090.089	So if we're worried because
0:28:31.090.089	0:28:32.450.450	in the P. Diddy case it
0:28:32.450.450	0:28:33.710.710	looks like the LAPD at the
0:28:33.710.710	0:28:34.550.549	very top might have been
0:28:34.550.549	0:28:35.470.470	involved with something if
0:28:35.470.470	0:28:36.470.470	that's the if that's the
0:28:36.470.470	0:28:38.150.150	claim I mean isn't Donald
0:28:38.150.150	0:28:39.170.170	Trump at the very very very
0:28:39.170.170	0:28:40.170.170	top if he's the president
0:28:40.170.170	0:28:41.170.170	isn't he literally like the
0:28:41.170.170	0:28:42.090.089	top guy in the world?
0:28:42.310.309	0:28:43.010.009	He doesn't control the
0:28:43.010.009	0:28:44.010.009	courts and that's I mean
0:28:44.010.009	0:28:46.110.109	the point of exactly being
0:28:46.110.109	0:28:47.290.289	is that if they feel that
0:28:47.290.289	0:28:48.450.450	they have a person that they
0:28:48.450.450	0:28:49.810.809	cannot control so if there is
0:28:49.810.809	0:28:50.670.670	this blackmail ring that
0:28:50.670.670	0:28:52.210.210	exists and it's starting to
0:28:52.210.210	0:28:53.130.130	look like there is
0:28:53.130.130	0:28:54.870.869	definitively and I very much
0:28:54.870.869	0:28:55.910.910	believe that and I am not
0:28:55.910.910	0:28:57.870.869	ashamed to say that I is it
0:28:57.870.869	0:28:58.930.930	is pretty much the only thing
0:28:58.930.930	0:29:00.350.349	that makes sense in Hollywood is
0:29:00.350.349	0:29:01.590.589	what I read in these documents
0:29:01.590.589	0:29:06.270.269	then it would be clear as to
0:29:06.270.269	0:29:07.710.710	why it is that when you are
0:29:07.710.710	0:29:09.590.589	existing outside of the ring or
0:29:09.590.589	0:29:10.710.710	you are somebody that cannot be
0:29:10.710.710	0:29:12.710.710	controlled you are somebody that
0:29:12.710.710	0:29:14.810.809	is attacked now again we have
0:29:14.810.809	0:29:16.490.490	heard many artists and I like
0:29:16.490.490	0:29:17.770.769	that we have this example in
0:29:17.770.769	0:29:19.190.190	Hollywood because we don't need
0:29:19.190.190	0:29:20.250.250	to go down the path of Trump
0:29:20.250.250	0:29:21.150.150	derangement we can actually
0:29:21.150.150	0:29:22.370.369	talk about people that we
0:29:22.370.369	0:29:23.310.309	don't feel any way about
0:29:23.310.309	0:29:24.110.109	right Diddy I don't have an
0:29:24.110.109	0:29:25.470.470	issue with Diddy you don't have
0:29:25.470.470	0:29:26.310.309	an issue with Diddy we can
0:29:26.310.309	0:29:27.430.430	look at this case more
0:29:27.430.430	0:29:28.850.849	objectively because people I
0:29:28.850.849	0:29:31.670.670	think do get so about Trump
0:29:31.670.670	0:29:32.970.970	that you you can't just look at
0:29:32.970.970	0:29:34.570.569	things objectively if what he
0:29:34.570.569	0:29:35.770.769	that person is that way do you
0:29:35.770.769	0:29:36.370.369	think that's what happened
0:29:36.370.369	0:29:40.270.269	here I mean I I you did jump
0:29:40.270.269	0:29:42.110.109	I'm glad it's live and you can
0:29:42.110.109	0:29:42.870.869	go back and watch it but like I
0:29:42.870.869	0:29:43.610.609	didn't get if you asked me a
0:29:43.610.609	0:29:44.610.609	question and then before I could
0:29:44.610.609	0:29:46.690.690	answer my question you did say
0:29:46.690.690	0:29:47.570.569	like narrative and I'm like
0:29:47.570.569	0:29:48.930.930	okay that feels like the the
0:29:48.930.930	0:29:50.230.230	Trump derangement trap I don't
0:29:50.230.230	0:29:51.070.069	want to do it I want to have a
0:29:51.070.069	0:29:52.730.730	productive conversation about
0:29:52.730.730	0:29:54.090.089	the plausibility that people that
0:29:54.090.089	0:29:56.130.130	are extremely powerful are
0:29:56.130.130	0:29:57.850.849	blackmailing people and these
0:29:57.850.849	0:29:59.270.269	people can't talk out don't
0:29:59.270.269	0:30:00.070.069	can't speak out because
0:30:00.070.069	0:30:01.090.089	whatever they have on them on
0:30:01.090.089	0:30:03.610.609	camera is scary you know
0:30:03.610.609	0:30:05.350.349	there's Justin Bieber I think
0:30:05.350.349	0:30:06.330.329	there's also something going
0:30:06.330.329	0:30:10.050.049	on with him he is his pastor
0:30:10.050.049	0:30:11.470.470	said you know pray for them
0:30:11.470.470	0:30:13.150.150	there are evil forces that in
0:30:13.150.150	0:30:14.390.390	Hollywood kind of at the same
0:30:14.390.390	0:30:15.990.990	time as this Cat Williams I
0:30:15.990.990	0:30:17.310.309	know he used to do crack
0:30:17.310.309	0:30:19.030.029	whatever has spoken out about
0:30:19.030.029	0:30:19.910.910	this there's been a lot of
0:30:19.910.910	0:30:20.630.630	artists that have spoken out
0:30:20.630.630	0:30:22.030.029	about this Kanye West has
0:30:22.030.029	0:30:23.930.930	spoken out about this about you
0:30:23.930.930	0:30:25.010.009	know the control and the
0:30:25.010.009	0:30:25.870.869	network that's happening
0:30:25.870.869	0:30:27.330.329	within Hollywood so I think
0:30:27.330.329	0:30:30.070.069	instead of I don't know
0:30:30.070.069	0:30:32.690.690	trying to dismiss these people
0:30:32.690.690	0:30:35.850.849	as crazy or crackheads or
0:30:35.850.849	0:30:36.750.750	whatever it is you want to
0:30:36.750.750	0:30:38.070.069	dismiss them as when enough
0:30:38.070.069	0:30:39.190.190	people say something including
0:30:39.190.190	0:30:40.150.150	Michael Jackson who's dead
0:30:40.150.150	0:30:41.990.990	maybe there's some truth to it
0:30:41.990.990	0:30:43.330.329	like can we examine whether or
0:30:43.330.329	0:30:44.610.609	not this might be true
0:30:44.610.609	0:30:46.030.029	especially when somebody is such
0:30:46.030.029	0:30:47.890.890	an underdog like a producer and
0:30:47.890.890	0:30:49.530.529	does something like this I think
0:30:49.530.529	0:30:51.450.450	analyzing who's saying what I
0:30:51.450.450	0:30:52.770.769	think is important but I think
0:30:52.770.769	0:30:53.230.230	that when we say that
0:30:53.230.230	0:30:54.110.109	somebody's an underdog so we're
0:30:54.110.109	0:30:54.790.789	going to believe them because
0:30:54.790.789	0:30:55.730.730	they give a story that we might
0:30:55.730.730	0:30:56.750.750	happen to like or place into
0:30:56.750.750	0:30:57.610.609	something else that we believe
0:30:57.610.609	0:30:58.990.990	I mean I would just be critical of
0:30:58.990.990	0:31:00.290.289	the underlying material like if
0:31:00.290.289	0:31:01.130.130	the sources are a few people
0:31:01.130.130	0:31:02.310.309	like everybody stands to gain
0:31:02.310.309	0:31:03.710.710	something when it comes to viral
0:31:03.710.710	0:31:04.750.750	stuff everybody knows that
0:31:04.750.750	0:31:05.870.869	you have outrageous claims to
0:31:05.870.869	0:31:06.990.990	make yeah and if he has
0:31:06.990.990	0:31:08.330.329	evidence yeah I think that's
0:31:08.330.329	0:31:09.350.349	interesting otherwise I would
0:31:09.350.349	0:31:10.410.410	have said I don't know it's
0:31:10.410.410	0:31:11.350.349	frivolous like there's you can
0:31:11.350.349	0:31:12.270.269	always sue a rich person
0:31:12.270.269	0:31:12.890.890	but I'm saying I'm also
0:31:12.890.890	0:31:14.450.450	saying that like a charge is a
0:31:14.450.450	0:31:15.770.769	charge or a claim is a claim
0:31:15.770.769	0:31:16.570.569	or a filed case a filed case
0:31:16.570.569	0:31:17.650.650	it'll be interesting to see what
0:31:17.650.650	0:31:18.770.769	ends up playing out in court
0:31:18.770.769	0:31:20.210.210	and then we actually see that
0:31:20.210.210	0:31:21.730.730	that's what I want to see I'm
0:31:21.730.730	0:31:22.670.670	not condemning the person I'm
0:31:22.670.670	0:31:23.690.690	not a person that believes that
0:31:23.690.690	0:31:26.150.150	you I would hope and I
0:31:26.150.150	0:31:27.910.910	obviously have lost faith in
0:31:27.910.910	0:31:29.870.869	in the court system in some
0:31:29.870.869	0:31:31.190.190	ways but I would hope that it
0:31:31.190.190	0:31:32.170.170	works the way it's supposed to
0:31:32.170.170	0:31:33.730.730	work and that it will take more
0:31:33.730.730	0:31:35.730.730	evidence and that he has to
0:31:35.730.730	0:31:37.110.109	appear in front of people and
0:31:37.110.109	0:31:38.470.470	show us more evidence and show
0:31:38.470.470	0:31:40.270.269	us more video evidence of
0:31:40.270.269	0:31:42.230.230	what's going on but when you see
0:31:42.230.230	0:31:43.610.609	what I will say is that it
0:31:43.610.609	0:31:45.830.829	looks credible okay when you
0:31:45.830.829	0:31:46.750.750	say that you've lost faith in
0:31:46.750.750	0:31:47.670.670	the court system does that mean
0:31:47.670.670	0:31:48.830.829	that if a guilty verdict is
0:31:48.830.829	0:31:50.210.210	returned you'll think it was a
0:31:50.210.210	0:31:51.590.589	good case but if a non guilty
0:31:51.590.589	0:31:54.170.170	verdict okay well why would
0:31:54.170.170	0:31:55.010.009	you why would you preface with
0:31:55.010.009	0:31:56.190.190	I've lost faith faith in the
0:31:56.190.190	0:31:57.650.650	court system because I have seen
0:31:57.650.650	0:32:00.110.109	some circumstances in which
0:32:00.110.109	0:32:02.690.690	things that should not happen do
0:32:02.690.690	0:32:04.770.769	happen and a good example of
0:32:04.770.769	0:32:05.830.829	that if you want to talk about
0:32:05.830.829	0:32:07.370.369	the craziest case that I followed
0:32:07.370.369	0:32:08.770.769	in a long while it was the
0:32:08.770.769	0:32:11.190.190	defamation one where the jury
0:32:11.190.190	0:32:13.230.230	awarded she was asking for what
0:32:13.230.230	0:32:14.970.970	10 million and they awarded her
0:32:14.970.970	0:32:17.810.809	for 400 800 million just to like
0:32:17.810.809	0:32:19.170.170	bankrupt Trump and her
0:32:19.170.170	0:32:20.690.690	allegations had expired but they
0:32:20.690.690	0:32:22.350.349	created a new law in New York so
0:32:22.350.349	0:32:23.450.450	that she could bring them forth
0:32:23.450.450	0:32:25.350.349	about something that she says
0:32:25.350.349	0:32:27.150.150	happened in 1996 what is that
0:32:27.150.150	0:32:28.570.569	whack lady's name she got and
0:32:28.570.569	0:32:29.590.589	she she was so you're talking
0:32:29.590.589	0:32:30.390.390	about when they extended the
0:32:30.390.390	0:32:32.230.230	Carol E Jean Carroll statute of
0:32:32.230.230	0:32:33.450.450	limitations to allow people to
0:32:33.450.450	0:32:34.350.349	sue people we're letting to
0:32:34.350.349	0:32:36.130.130	and then she got funded to
0:32:36.130.130	0:32:38.190.190	reopen this they changed the law
0:32:38.190.190	0:32:40.210.210	and then she got funded by the
0:32:40.210.210	0:32:42.970.970	person who is basic I don't
0:32:42.970.970	0:32:43.570.569	want to call him a Democrat
0:32:43.570.569	0:32:45.270.269	operative but he obviously is
0:32:45.270.269	0:32:46.310.309	very involved Democratic Party
0:32:46.310.309	0:32:48.030.029	the person that um started
0:32:48.030.029	0:32:49.210.210	LinkedIn is the one that funded
0:32:49.210.210	0:32:51.330.329	her to do this lawsuit I mean the
0:32:51.330.329	0:32:52.210.210	whole thing is a crazy I've ever
0:32:52.210.210	0:32:53.550.549	seen I just like making new laws
0:32:53.550.549	0:32:54.970.970	I thought this law was changed in
0:32:54.970.970	0:32:56.370.369	New York a while ago no it wasn't
0:32:56.370.369	0:32:57.550.549	specifically for no it wasn't
0:32:57.550.549	0:32:59.750.750	nope it was specifically after
0:32:59.750.750	0:33:01.370.369	she went on and was doing the
0:33:01.370.369	0:33:04.150.150	rounds on uh and those were
0:33:04.150.150	0:33:05.410.410	wacky when she was like I don't
0:33:05.410.410	0:33:06.910.910	even know when he was like what
0:33:06.910.910	0:33:08.550.549	is rape Anderson Cooper asked her
0:33:08.550.549	0:33:10.090.089	and she was like I think most
0:33:10.090.089	0:33:11.910.910	people think rape is sexy it's
0:33:11.910.910	0:33:13.830.829	not someone jumping on you and
0:33:13.830.829	0:33:15.870.869	you know it'd be great for this if
0:33:15.870.869	0:33:17.070.069	you could bring up clips like that
0:33:17.070.069	0:33:18.250.250	because it would be awesome for
0:33:18.250.250	0:33:19.350.349	people to be able to watch it but
0:33:19.350.349	0:33:20.930.930	she was so clearly clinically
0:33:20.930.930	0:33:22.210.210	insane there's no she was so
0:33:22.210.210	0:33:23.310.309	insane that even Anderson Cooper
0:33:23.310.309	0:33:24.910.910	had to go to commercial MSNBC had
0:33:24.910.910	0:33:26.650.650	to go to commercial so this is not
0:33:26.650.650	0:33:28.730.730	a woman you know that was making
0:33:28.730.730	0:33:31.510.509	what any person who can listen to
0:33:31.510.509	0:33:32.990.990	somebody interview about their rape
0:33:32.990.990	0:33:34.490.490	would say are credible
0:33:34.490.490	0:33:37.110.109	allegations but there was just such
0:33:37.110.109	0:33:38.830.829	hatred for Trump that they just
0:33:38.830.829	0:33:40.930.930	made it happen and in no
0:33:40.930.930	0:33:42.750.750	circumstances I can't imagine what
0:33:42.750.750	0:33:44.130.130	circumstances somebody asks for like
0:33:44.130.130	0:33:45.290.289	10 million and the judge is like
0:33:45.290.289	0:33:46.770.769	no you're gonna give you 400 million
0:33:46.770.769	0:33:47.910.910	other than we hate Trump so much
0:33:47.910.910	0:33:48.790.789	we hope to bankrupt him
0:33:48.790.789	0:33:51.590.589	what was this a jury trial uh there
0:33:51.590.589	0:33:52.610.609	were multiple parts of this
0:33:52.610.609	0:33:54.730.730	lawsuit but uh it was
0:33:54.730.730	0:33:57.450.450	because if it went to trial and if
0:33:57.450.450	0:33:58.990.990	it was a jury then yeah it was it
0:33:58.990.990	0:33:59.690.690	was jury trial yes
0:33:59.690.690	0:34:00.670.670	does anyone have a link to that
0:34:00.670.670	0:34:02.170.170	rape clue I'm curious yeah yeah
0:34:02.170.170	0:34:03.930.930	yeah it's it's rape we just gotta
0:34:03.930.930	0:34:05.590.589	look at it it's so nutty and so
0:34:05.590.589	0:34:07.810.809	crazy and they just kept going with
0:34:07.810.809	0:34:09.070.070	it everywhere she went left and
0:34:09.070.070	0:34:10.150.150	right people could not hold a
0:34:10.150.150	0:34:11.210.210	conversation with her she was so
0:34:11.210.210	0:34:12.930.929	unstable and she couldn't even
0:34:12.930.929	0:34:14.410.409	define what rape was she was just
0:34:14.410.409	0:34:15.490.489	saying I think rape is just like
0:34:15.490.489	0:34:16.710.710	you know when someone thinks you're
0:34:16.710.710	0:34:17.770.769	sexy so it's like so did Trump
0:34:17.770.769	0:34:19.510.510	just think you were sexy she had no
0:34:19.510.510	0:34:20.650.650	witness I mean I've just never seen
0:34:20.650.650	0:34:22.870.869	anybody able to get for or however
0:34:22.870.869	0:34:24.630.630	many millions dollars she got with
0:34:24.630.630	0:34:26.330.329	absolutely not a shred of proof and a
0:34:26.330.329	0:34:27.410.409	case that shouldn't have even have
0:34:27.410.409	0:34:28.730.730	been brought forward according to
0:34:28.730.730	0:34:29.770.769	according to your own statute of
0:34:29.770.769	0:34:31.150.150	limitations also people are saying
0:34:31.150.150	0:34:32.970.969	that the 400 million is the that's
0:34:32.970.969	0:34:34.590.590	for the business fraud case maybe
0:34:34.590.590	0:34:36.250.250	the I'm sorry yeah mixing numbers
0:34:36.250.250	0:34:37.510.510	what was the how much was she awarded
0:34:37.510.510	0:34:38.650.650	for you guys that are like yeah
0:34:38.650.650	0:34:40.170.170	checking she was awarded they gave
0:34:40.170.170	0:34:41.830.829	her more than she even asked for yeah
0:34:41.830.829	0:34:43.430.429	they literally extended the law it was
0:34:43.430.429	0:34:45.150.150	in the whole thing was so rotten to
0:34:45.150.150	0:34:47.350.349	its core that makes you lose faith
0:34:47.350.349	0:34:49.010.010	right that makes you lose faith in the
0:34:49.010.010	0:34:49.950.949	justice and that's not saying that
0:34:49.950.949	0:34:51.310.309	there aren't cases there are
0:34:51.310.309	0:34:52.570.570	different judges there are different
0:34:52.570.570	0:34:54.730.730	you know different juries some with
0:34:54.730.730	0:34:56.210.210	Trump it's hard because people are
0:34:56.210.210	0:34:57.450.449	passionate about him one way or the
0:34:57.450.449	0:35:00.270.269	other so you're it's going to be hard
0:35:00.270.269	0:35:01.410.409	not to find a jury that is corrupt
0:35:01.410.409	0:35:03.090.090	especially when you're in New York but
0:35:03.090.090	0:35:04.450.449	I don't see how many person can
0:35:04.450.449	0:35:05.770.769	objectively look at what happened
0:35:05.770.769	0:35:06.130.130	there
0:35:06.130.130	0:35:07.410.409	wait what does that mean a corrupt
0:35:07.410.409	0:35:07.850.849	jury
0:35:07.850.849	0:35:10.970.969	like like emotionally corrupted because
0:35:10.970.969	0:35:12.810.809	when it comes to Trump people tend to
0:35:12.810.809	0:35:14.930.929	feel either I love him so much or I
0:35:14.930.929	0:35:15.870.869	absolutely hate him and he's the end
0:35:15.870.869	0:35:18.490.489	of the world so I think it's hard to
0:35:18.490.489	0:35:22.030.030	get a jury that you know is going to be
0:35:22.030.030	0:35:23.430.429	fair in that circumstance because he's
0:35:23.430.429	0:35:25.330.329	so do you know where is p diddy being
0:35:25.330.329	0:35:28.430.429	sued at do you know the venue is I want
0:35:28.430.429	0:35:30.430.429	to say LA I want to say LA but
0:35:30.430.429	0:35:31.710.710	definitely fact check me on that so I
0:35:31.710.710	0:35:39.220.219	don't spread misinformation I'm only
0:35:39.220.219	0:35:40.680.679	asking because I see a couple people oh
0:35:40.680.679	0:35:43.220.219	so for this it says Rodney uh little
0:35:43.220.219	0:35:45.460.460	Rod Jones oh New York that's right it
0:35:45.460.460	0:35:47.160.159	is in New York wait that is correct
0:35:47.160.159	0:35:49.200.199	does that mean that the the opening up
0:35:49.200.199	0:35:50.440.440	of the statute of limitations for the
0:35:50.440.440	0:35:51.760.760	Trump suit is the same thing that's
0:35:51.760.760	0:35:53.300.300	allowing this court case to go through
0:35:53.300.300	0:35:55.960.960	then no no he you got to look at what
0:35:55.960.960	0:35:57.840.840	he's suing them for this all happened
0:35:57.840.840	0:35:59.620.619	recently the Trump thing happened in 96
0:35:59.620.619	0:36:01.560.559	just so you just so we're clear this
0:36:01.560.559	0:36:05.020.019	happened in 2022 21 all the allegations
0:36:05.020.019	0:36:07.020.019	are recent yeah it just happened he was
0:36:07.020.019	0:36:08.860.860	working on an album that he dropped
0:36:08.860.860	0:36:10.140.139	like last year or something it's not
0:36:10.140.139	0:36:12.440.440	from 1996 oh okay I thought the way you
0:36:12.440.440	0:36:13.240.239	were talking I thought these were early
0:36:13.240.239	0:36:15.300.300	allegations no no no no this all just
0:36:15.300.300	0:36:16.940.940	happened and he obtained a ton of proof
0:36:16.940.940	0:36:19.040.039	because of it gotcha gotcha have you
0:36:19.040.039	0:36:20.140.139	reached out to this guy to try to have
0:36:20.140.139	0:36:21.640.639	a conversation with him or anything no
0:36:21.640.639	0:36:26.800.800	I would hope that that would be I would
0:36:26.800.800	0:36:27.800.800	imagine I mean I don't I don't know if
0:36:27.800.800	0:36:29.340.340	you would be able to while you're I don't
0:36:29.340.340	0:36:31.260.260	know while you're in court I'm sure his
0:36:31.260.260	0:36:32.960.960	lawyer would say don't speak until things
0:36:32.960.960	0:36:35.200.199	are done and I'm my guess is that
0:36:35.200.199	0:36:37.640.639	because of the powerful names that are
0:36:37.640.639	0:36:39.760.760	listed in this lawsuit they're gonna want
0:36:39.760.760	0:36:41.260.260	to just settle it and be done with it
0:36:41.260.260	0:36:43.660.659	but the photos that are pictured there
0:36:43.660.659	0:36:45.780.780	it's gonna be very hard I think to come
0:36:45.780.780	0:36:47.280.280	back from it without some sort of an
0:36:47.280.280	0:36:50.700.699	explanation I mean he named names well
0:36:50.700.699	0:36:52.240.239	I think the problem my imagination be
0:36:52.240.239	0:36:53.520.519	the problem is that even if the photos
0:36:53.520.519	0:36:55.380.380	show sexual acts or whatever the
0:36:55.380.380	0:36:56.580.579	difficult part is going to be proving
0:36:56.580.579	0:36:58.020.019	that these were part of a conspiracy to
0:36:58.020.019	0:36:59.700.699	blackmail or something like that right
0:36:59.700.699	0:37:02.940.940	because just photos of people having
0:37:02.940.940	0:37:04.140.139	sex or doing whatever stuff isn't
0:37:04.140.139	0:37:05.040.039	probably enough unless you've got like
0:37:05.040.039	0:37:07.440.440	text messages showing some pattern of
0:37:07.440.440	0:37:11.280.280	yeah I think I think yeah I guess you what
0:37:11.280.280	0:37:13.500.500	you're saying is that people could then say
0:37:13.500.500	0:37:14.860.860	okay well they're all having sex but
0:37:14.860.860	0:37:16.680.679	they're doing it willingly but what he's
0:37:16.680.679	0:37.000	alleging is that Diddy's team gets these
0:37.000	0:37:22.940.940	people drunk and high and drugged and
0:37:22.940.940	0:37:25.200.199	then brings in women that are they know
0:37:25.200.199	0:37:26.760.760	are minors this is one part of his
0:37:26.760.760	0:37:28.920.920	allegations and then these people have sex
0:37:28.920.920	0:37:32.140.139	with them or they have look at have gay
0:37:32.140.139	0:37:33.960.960	relations and like everyone's doing it
0:37:33.960.960	0:37:35.280.280	everyone's doing it and then they do
0:37:35.280.280	0:37:36.660.659	something that's like gay while they're
0:37:36.660.659	0:37:39.560.559	high and then he owns them because he has
0:37:39.560.559	0:37:41.900.900	this stuff that's on cameras now explaining
0:37:41.900.900	0:37:45.560.559	yeah could you could you technically even
0:37:45.560.559	0:37:47.220.219	after it's all exposed say like oh well
0:37:47.220.219	0:37:48.780.780	maybe they all did it willingly sure you
0:37:48.780.780	0:37:50.140.139	could always sure well I mean the burden
0:37:50.140.139	0:37:51.940.940	would be on him to prove at least which
0:37:51.940.940	0:37:53.680.679	is why I really want this to go through
0:37:53.680.679	0:37:55.180.179	because there's just been a lot of
0:37:55.180.179	0:37:56.600.599	artists who have said this over the
0:37:56.600.599	0:37:58.980.980	years that there's like some sort of gang
0:37:58.980.980	0:38:01.500.500	that's operating in Hollywood and I would
0:38:01.500.500	0:38:03.360.360	just like to see these allegations play
0:38:03.360.360	0:38.000	out you know and I think everyone should
0:38.000	0:38:06.980.980	want that by the way what do you think
0:38:06.980.980	0:38:09.340.340	on a on a broad level yeah okay so you
0:38:09.340.340	0:38:11.280.280	keep calling me contrarian on a broad
0:38:11.280.280	0:38:12.760.760	level the reason why I tend to fight
0:38:12.760.760	0:38:14.060.059	back against the overarching narratives
0:38:14.060.059	0:38:15.520.519	because I feel like they leave listeners
0:38:15.520.519	0:38:18.100.099	feeling very powerless so when I talk to
0:38:18.100.099	0:38:19.540.539	my audience I want people to vote I want
0:38:19.540.539	0:38:20.900.900	people to be politically active I want
0:38:20.900.900	0:38:22.400.400	people to you know take an interest in
0:38:22.400.400	0:38:23.880.880	their local city council stuff their
0:38:23.880.880	0:38:25.520.519	local races because I think that people
0:38:25.520.519	0:38:26.740.739	getting involved politically especially
0:38:26.740.739	0:38:28.080.079	voting is a really important way to
0:38:28.080.079	0:38:30.880.880	change the landscape of our country on a
0:38:30.880.880	0:38:32.140.139	local level or international level I
0:38:32.140.139	0:38:33.700.699	agree I also think that people talking
0:38:33.700.699	0:38:35.160.159	to their friends and family and spreading
0:38:35.160.159	0:38:36.380.380	ideas and messages I think these things
0:38:36.380.380	0:38:38.560.559	are important as well but I think that
0:38:38.560.559	0:38:40.140.139	the reason why I push back sometimes
0:38:40.140.139	0:38:42.420.420	against the broader when I say narrative
0:38:42.420.420	0:38:43.420.420	by the way I don't necessarily mean that
0:38:43.420.420	0:38:44.440.440	it's like conspiracy theory or whatever
0:38:44.440.440	0:38:45.780.780	but the reason why I push back against
0:38:45.780.780	0:38:47.400.400	like the more broader narrativizing of
0:38:47.400.400	0:38:48.760.760	things happening culturally because I
0:38:48.760.760	0:38:50.040.039	feel like it leaves listeners feeling
0:38:50.040.039	0:38:51.880.880	very disempowered I remember when I was
0:38:51.880.880	0:38:53.540.539	in Austin and I asked Alex Jones on
0:38:53.540.539	0:38:55.060.059	stage after he'd done another one of his
0:38:55.060.059	0:38:56.940.940	big rants about the deep state and
0:38:56.940.940	0:38.000	blah blah blah I think I asked I was
0:38.000	0:38:58.580.579	like well what do you want your
0:38:58.580.579	0:39:00.140.139	listeners to do and it was the first time
0:39:00.140.139	0:39:01.380.380	I ever heard him be quiet for more than
0:39:01.380.380	0:39:03.340.340	five seconds he had no answer so I'm
0:39:03.340.340	0:39:05.360.360	curious for you when you talk about
0:39:05.360.360	0:39:06.840.840	this overarching stuff you want to bring
0:39:06.840.840	0:39:08.460.460	people's attention to it what is like
0:39:08.460.460	0:39:10.740.739	a Candace Owens listener supposed to take
0:39:10.740.739	0:39:11.560.559	from that and what are they supposed to
0:39:11.560.559	0:39:12.480.480	do in the real world I guess to like
0:39:12.480.480	0:39:13.640.639	fight against some of the stuff yeah I
0:39:13.640.639	0:39:14.980.980	mean I always tell people what they can
0:39:14.980.980	0:39:16.700.699	do like one of the biggest pushes is
0:39:16.700.699	0:39:17.900.900	telling parents that they that they
0:39:17.900.900	0:39:18.920.920	should be involved in their kids
0:39:18.920.920	0:39:20.420.420	education and you saw that that was
0:39:20.420.420	0:39:21.960.960	that was conservatives who brought forth
0:39:21.960.960	0:39:23.760.760	that movement of parents actually showing
0:39:23.760.760	0:39:25.880.880	up and demanding changes in the
0:39:25.880.880	0:39:28.280.280	textbooks and finally recognizing how far
0:39:28.280.280	0:39:30.800.800	things had gone because we allowed the
0:39:30.800.800	0:39:31.980.980	Department of Education to just
0:39:31.980.980	0:39:34.980.980	spike the ball for for decades you know
0:39:34.980.980	0:39:36.680.679	actually paying attention to what they do I
0:39:36.680.679	0:39:38.100.099	always tell people to get involved in
0:39:38.100.099	0:39:39.680.679	local elections because they matter more
0:39:39.680.679	0:39:41.880.880	and I think that a lot of the corruption
0:39:41.880.880	0:39:44.880.880	that's taking place in Washington DC is
0:39:44.880.880	0:39:46.320.320	what we're what we're speaking about
0:39:46.320.320	0:39:47.740.739	because it seems like no matter who we
0:39:47.740.739	0:39:50.660.659	elect when we send them to Washington DC
0:39:50.660.659	0:39:54.700.699	it's almost like their allegiance is to
0:39:54.700.699	0:39:57.020.019	the lobbies and by the way I believe that
0:39:57.020.019	0:39:59.600.599	lobbying should be illegal I believe that
0:39:59.600.599	0:40:01.300.300	we need term limits these are the things
0:40:01.300.300	0:40:04.460.460	that would I think affect change
0:40:04.460.460	0:40:08.680.679	overnight and so I hope that in speaking
0:40:08.680.679	0:40:10.040.039	to those things when people say what
0:40:10.040.039	0:40:11.100.099	would be the first things that you would
0:40:11.100.099	0:40:14.780.780	do if you were in office I always say
0:40:14.780.780	0:40:18.260.260	elect people that are saying those exact
0:40:18.260.260	0:40:19.680.679	same things don't let people that are
0:40:19.680.679	0:40:21.120.119	then going to go to DC and make it their
0:40:21.120.119	0:40:22.700.699	own business you know and want to grow
0:40:22.700.699	0:40:24.040.039	the government because it's making the
0:40:24.040.039	0:40:25.280.280	money and they're accepting money from
0:40:25.280.280	0:40:27.140.139	lobbyists that's why I always point to my
0:40:27.140.139	0:40:29.360.360	favorite congressman Thomas Massey because
0:40:29.360.360	0:40:31.560.559	I think he does a really good job of
0:40:31.560.559	0:40:34.020.019	actually representing Americans and
0:40:34.020.019	0:40:37.340.340	American interests so yeah I'm not a
0:40:37.340.340	0:40:40.500.500	person I haven't taken the black pill as
0:40:40.500.500	0:40:42.560.559	they as how it's termed taking the black
0:40:42.560.559	0:40:43.480.480	pill and I'm like there's nothing you can
0:40:43.480.480	0:40:45.540.539	do but we have to understand what it is
0:40:45.540.539	0:40:46.600.599	that we're fighting and we can't be
0:40:46.600.599	0:40:50.040.039	scared to recognize a conspiracy you know
0:40:50.040.039	0:40:51.360.360	a lot of times we're just talking
0:40:51.360.360	0:40:52.700.699	there's questions that we have and we
0:40:52.700.699	0:40:53.880.880	just say why is this person doing this
0:40:53.880.880	0:40:56.440.440	like I said the Diddy lawsuit didn't make
0:40:56.440.440	0:40:58.880.880	me feel hopeless it actually made me go
0:40:58.880.880	0:41:00.640.639	oh okay if this is what's actually
0:41:00.640.639	0:41:02.480.480	happening in Hollywood then it makes
0:41:02.480.480	0:41:04.580.579	sense you know what do you think for
0:41:04.580.579	0:41:06.160.159	when you look at black community stuff
0:41:06.160.159	0:41:08.460.460	specifically what do you what would you
0:41:08.460.460	0:41:09.620.619	think are the big like two or three
0:41:09.620.619	0:41:11.060.059	things that the black community in the
0:41:11.060.059	0:41:12.340.340	United States needs to do to kind of
0:41:12.340.340	0:41:15.500.500	save itself from the whole of you know
0:41:15.500.500	0:41:17.840.840	fatherless children and welfare consumption
0:41:17.840.840	0:41:18.960.960	and abortion everything else that they're
0:41:18.960.960	0:41:20.720.719	kind of stuck in right now the first thing I
0:41:20.720.719	0:41:22.340.340	think is is to educate yourself about
0:41:22.340.340	0:41:23.660.659	where it's all coming from I think black
0:41:23.660.659	0:41:25.120.119	Americans need to be educated on black
0:41:25.120.119	0:41:27.720.719	history not in the Democrat textbook way
0:41:27.720.719	0:41:29.640.639	but in the real way of understanding
0:41:29.640.639	0:41:31.400.400	where all these initiatives came from
0:41:31.400.400	0:41:32.960.960	because a lot of times black Americans
0:41:32.960.960	0:41:34.540.539	are asking the government to solve what
0:41:34.540.539	0:41:36.080.079	the government created which welfare
0:41:36.080.079	0:41:37.480.480	programs obviously destroyed the black
0:41:37.480.480	0:41:39.460.460	family and it was the intention of
0:41:39.460.460	0:41:40.760.760	Lyndon Baines Johnson to do that
0:41:40.760.760	0:41:42.760.760	because he wasn't about racist and spent
0:41:42.760.760	0:41:44.920.920	decades in the Senate voting against
0:41:44.920.920	0:41:46.560.559	every measure to give black Americans
0:41:46.560.559	0:41:48.780.780	any measure of freedom until he was
0:41:48.780.780	0:41:50.900.900	basically forced with a figurative bullet to
0:41:50.900.900	0:41:54.240.239	his head to sign the Civil Rights Act to
0:41:54.240.239	0:41:56.280.280	restore some calm nationally so I think
0:41:56.280.280	0:41:57.340.340	first of all everything we get to the
0:41:57.340.340	0:42:00.300.300	education and I think that people that
0:42:00.300.300	0:42:01.700.699	are nefarious understand that which is
0:42:01.700.699	0:42:04.220.219	why the seventy percent illiteracy rate
0:42:04.220.219	0:42:06.020.019	that we're seeing across inner city
0:42:06.020.019	0:42:09.920.920	communities is is in my opinion by design
0:42:09.920.920	0:42:11.840.840	forty percent of students now can't pass the
0:42:11.840.840	0:42:14.300.300	literacy exam excluding black America when
0:42:14.300.300	0:42:16.220.219	we say by design who would want that who
0:42:16.220.219	0:42:17.820.820	people that want to control you there's a
0:42:17.820.820	0:42:22.080.079	reason why when we had slave codes slaves
0:42:22.080.079	0:42:23.200.199	weren't allowed to learn how to read when
0:42:23.200.199	0:42:24.580.579	you're not educated anything I tell you
0:42:24.580.579	0:42:26.100.099	becomes your reality if I can understand
0:42:26.100.099	0:42:27.820.820	that but like that but slaves like worked
0:42:27.820.820	0:42:29.880.880	and did stuff right I feel like the American
0:42:29.880.880	0:42:31.620.619	sort of two Americans every day we go to
0:42:31.620.619	0:42:33.580.579	work and our money gets sent over but they
0:42:33.580.579	0:42:35.120.119	have to like be literate to go to work right I
0:42:35.120.119	0:42:36.720.719	feel like illiterate black people that are
0:42:36.720.719	0:42:38.260.260	doing gang violence probably aren't serving
0:42:38.260.260	0:42:40.620.619	any system very well you are because you
0:42:40.620.619	0:42:42.020.019	keep voting in the people that are taking
0:42:42.020.019	0:42:43.680.679	more power from you right those people are
0:42:43.680.679	0:42:45.240.239	voting much the black gang bangers and
0:42:45.240.239	0:42:47.760.760	stuff I think yes black people do vote and
0:42:47.760.760	0:42:48.060.059	it's not
0:42:48.060.059	0:42:49.500.500	wait wait hold on to be very clear I didn't
0:42:49.500.500	0:42.000	say black people because I don't think that
0:42.000	0:42:52.620.619	all black people are like this I'm saying
0:42:52.620.619	0:42.000	that like that specifically the ones that
0:42.000	0:42:55.620.619	are illiterate involved in gang violence
0:42:55.620.619	0:42:56.940.940	and are unemployed do you think that
0:42:56.940.940	0:42:58.580.579	they're like out there voting in a
0:42:58.580.579	0:43:00.840.840	meaningful way that's changing that the I
0:43:00.840.840	0:43:01.860.860	guess the political landscape the United
0:43:01.860.860	0:43:02.940.940	States are they having like a meaningful
0:43:02.940.940	0:43:05.340.340	impact on the electoral system yeah so even
0:43:05.340.340	0:43:07.740.739	if people are fully illiterate they will
0:43:07.740.739	0:43:09.720.719	vote if they have an emotional reason to
0:43:09.720.719	0:43.000	vote which is what the Democrats very much
0:43.000	0:43:13.500.500	understand I want to actually want to
0:43:13.500.500	0:43:15.240.239	correct my language there and say because
0:43:15.240.239	0:43:17.040.039	I think it's it's uniparty at this point
0:43:17.040.039	0:43:19.320.320	that they will continue to vote
0:43:19.320.320	0:43:20.880.880	emotionally so when you see something
0:43:20.880.880	0:43:24.500.500	like you know black people rioting and
0:43:24.500.500	0:43:26.580.579	looting in the streets because of what
0:43:26.580.579	0:43:28.480.480	happened to George Floyd what you are
0:43:28.480.480	0:43:30.280.280	dealing with is people that are being
0:43:30.280.280	0:43:33.680.679	intentionally misinformed about
0:43:33.680.679	0:43:35.420.420	circumstances so that they are emotionally
0:43:35.420.420	0:43:37.120.119	reactive because I mean look I have
0:43:37.120.119	0:43:38.940.940	children I have a three-year-old I know
0:43:38.940.940	0:43:41.300.300	what it means to be ignorant my child
0:43:41.300.300	0:43:44.320.320	can't read he is emotionally reactive and
0:43:44.320.320	0:43:46.360.360	if you can turn an entire population
0:43:46.360.360	0:43:48.800.800	into an emotionally reactive toddler
0:43:48.800.800	0:43:50.440.440	that has no facts or no understanding of
0:43:50.440.440	0:43:53.120.119	history you can make them do whatever it
0:43:53.120.119	0:43:54.960.960	is that you want them to do so my it's
0:43:54.960.960	0:43:56.040.039	interesting because it feels like the
0:43:56.040.039	0:43:57.740.739	most like we would say the most mind
0:43:57.740.739	0:43:59.520.519	control people in America are actually
0:43:59.520.519	0:44:01.600.599	like young white college kids and those
0:44:01.600.599	0:44:03.040.039	guys have lots of literacy and lots of
0:44:03.040.039	0:44:04.160.159	education so I don't know why we
0:44:04.160.159	0:44:05.560.559	wouldn't send black people into like
0:44:05.560.559	0:44:07.460.460	the college actually instead of actually
0:44:07.460.460	0:44:09.620.619	no the but that's actually interesting I'm
0:44:09.620.619	0:44:11.040.039	glad you brought up college because if you
0:44:11.040.039	0:44:13.580.579	look factually speaking Americans have
0:44:13.580.579	0:44:14.880.880	are getting dumber and dumber and dumber
0:44:14.880.880	0:44:16.260.260	and dumber and dumber and yet we have
0:44:16.260.260	0:44:17.820.820	never handed out more degrees which is
0:44:17.820.820	0:44:19.040.039	interesting like I mean when you say
0:44:19.040.039	0:44.000	Americans are getting dumber what do you
0:44.000	0:44:21.680.679	mean what I mean that I mean talking about
0:44:21.680.679	0:44:25.580.579	in terms of passing tests passing exams
0:44:25.580.579	0:44:27.420.420	the literacy level in America everything
0:44:27.420.420	0:44.000	is actually going down and like SAT
0:44.000	0:44:31.840.840	scores everything is going down and
0:44:31.840.840	0:44:33.220.219	which is why they're now like let's just
0:44:33.220.219	0:44:35.200.199	abolish the SAT the sort of a thing that
0:44:35.200.199	0:44:36.780.780	they're which I think they've gotten rid of
0:44:36.780.780	0:44:38.080.079	and brought back in some places but I mean
0:44:38.080.079	0:44:39.340.340	like I don't know if the same people getting
0:44:39.340.340	0:44:40.800.800	illiterate are the same people that are
0:44:40.800.800	0:44:42.040.039	going to college and get a degree yeah
0:44:42.040.039	0:44:44.080.079	we're handing out degrees and yet people
0:44:44.080.079	0:44:45.580.579	so people think they're educated when
0:44:45.580.579	0:44:47.440.440	actually they're just brainwashed bots and
0:44:47.440.440	0:44:49.180.179	they're quite stupid they are stupid and
0:44:49.180.179	0:44:50.920.920	that's the magic of a college degree is
0:44:50.920.920	0:44:52.760.760	that it makes people think that they're
0:44:52.760.760	0:44:55.060.059	smart right in there and it's it's
0:44:55.060.059	0:44:56.980.980	astonishing you you really should examine
0:44:56.980.980	0:45:00.080.079	that how every decade within America
0:45:00.080.079	0:45:02.200.199	people are getting dumber and dumber and
0:45:02.200.199	0:45:04.280.280	dumber it's and one of the things that my
0:45:04.280.280	0:45:05.960.960	colleague Matt Walsh did which is really
0:45:05.960.960	0:45:09.220.219	incredible is he read a letter that was
0:45:09.220.219	0:45:12.180.179	written by a civil rights soldier who's
0:45:12.180.179	0:45:14.960.960	like 17 17 years old 18 years old had no
0:45:14.960.960	0:45:17.220.219	education and it sounded like poetry like
0:45:17.220.219	0:45:20.680.679	unbelievable the way people used to be
0:45:20.680.679	0:45:23.460.460	able to speak and write before we created
0:45:23.460.460	0:45:26.560.559	the Department of Education which in my
0:45:26.560.559	0:45:29.720.719	view it is there just to exist to turn you
0:45:29.720.719	0:45:31.540.539	into a mindless bot that will serve the
0:45:31.540.539	0:45:33.060.059	government's interests I mean we can say
0:45:33.060.059	0:45:35.160.159	that but the reality is is aside from the
0:45:35.160.159	0:45:36.680.679	cultural thing on the economic side
0:45:36.680.679	0:45:38.180.179	America has like one of the most
0:45:38.180.179	0:45:39.700.699	productive workforces maybe the most
0:45:39.700.699	0:45:41.220.219	productive workforce in the world when
0:45:41.220.219	0:45:43.120.119	you say productive workforce what do you
0:45:43.120.119	0:45:44.820.820	mean by that productive in an economic
0:45:44.820.820	0:45:47.660.659	sense is how many how many like units of
0:45:47.660.659	0:45:50.020.019	things are produced by one hour of labor
0:45:50.020.019	0:45:51.960.960	from a US worker and I'm pretty sure US
0:45:51.960.960	0:45:53.420.420	worker productivity is higher than it ever
0:45:53.420.420	0:45:54.760.760	has been I think that continues to climb
0:45:54.760.760	0:45:56.220.219	it's one of the biggest complaints about
0:45:56.220.219	0:45:57.900.900	lack of increase of wage growth for
0:45:57.900.900	0:45:59.060.059	instances that wage growth doesn't seem
0:45:59.060.059	0:46:00.580.579	to attract to the massive increase of
0:46:00.580.579	0:46:02.120.119	productivity of the average American
0:46:02.120.119	0:46:04.340.340	worker or the median American worker I
0:46:04.340.340	0:46:05.360.360	just think that like if you wanted to
0:46:05.360.360	0:46:06.980.980	control it just seems strange that we've
0:46:06.980.980	0:46:09.120.119	got to completely and totally diametrically
0:46:09.120.119	0:46:11.180.179	opposed ways of controlling society one
0:46:11.180.179	0:46:12.860.860	is to make black people specifically I
0:46:12.860.860	0:46:15.140.139	guess illiterate so that they are easier
0:46:15.140.139	0:46:16.320.320	to manipulate even though I seriously
0:46:16.320.320	0:46:17.620.619	doubt these people even vote that much
0:46:17.620.619	0:46:18.800.800	and then the other is to make people the
0:46:18.800.800	0:46:20.240.239	most literate by sending them to college
0:46:20.240.239	0:46:20.780.780	and have them read
0:46:20.780.780	0:46:21.880.880	they're not the most that's what I'm
0:46:21.880.880	0:46:22.960.960	telling you they are not the most
0:46:22.960.960	0:46:24.200.199	literate you think people graduate with
0:46:24.200.199	0:46.000	college degrees can't read well yeah what
0:46.000	0:46:27.220.219	I'm telling you is yes that's what I'm
0:46:27.220.219	0:46:28.080.079	telling you they're not the most
0:46:28.080.079	0:46:29.220.219	literate there were what I look at we
0:46:29.220.219	0:46:31.440.440	are not you gotta do you gotta do the
0:46:31.440.440	0:46:33.660.659	research in your own time I'm happy to
0:46:33.660.659	0:46:35.340.340	what do you what do you mean it's not
0:46:35.340.340	0:46:37.320.320	true just what I said as an owner of a
0:46:37.320.320	0:46:38.820.820	college degree median wage that doesn't
0:46:38.820.820	0:46:40.980.980	that person is like you own a you can go
0:46:40.980.980	0:46:42.600.599	to college for four years and spend a
0:46:42.600.599	0:46:44.040.039	hundred thousand dollars getting a
0:46:44.040.039	0:46:46.760.760	degree in gender studies please do not
0:46:46.760.760	0:46:48.360.360	tell me that you believe that that person
0:46:48.360.360	0:46:50.940.940	is educated or highly literate like it's
0:46:50.940.940	0:46:52.140.139	more than half a degree is awarded or
0:46:52.140.139	0:46:53.340.340	awarded for stem related things number
0:46:53.340.340	0:46:54.480.480	one number two a hundred thousand
0:46:54.480.480	0:46:55.900.900	dollars is a way over the average
0:46:55.900.900	0:46:57.660.659	paying for any that's what I paid so
0:46:57.660.659	0:46:58.920.920	I'm just what did you go to school for
0:46:58.920.920	0:47:01.680.679	the average and you as well as far as
0:47:01.680.679	0:47:03.040.039	I'm saying you can look this up but if
0:47:03.040.039	0:47:05.280.280	you are going to school you're probably
0:47:05.280.280	0:47:06.980.980	spending in America about thirty
0:47:06.980.980	0:47:09.100.099	thousand dollars a year minimally if
0:47:09.100.099	0:47:10.720.719	you're out of state isn't the average
0:47:10.720.719	0:47:12.160.159	amount of look it up you got it google
0:47:12.160.159	0:47:14.160.159	right what state are we in isn't the
0:47:14.160.159	0:47:15.840.840	way in Miami let's I mean let's go to
0:47:15.840.840	0:47:17.340.340	you look up University of Florida pardon
0:47:17.340.340	0:47:19.560.559	what state are we in Florida yeah go to
0:47:19.560.559	0:47:21.440.440	University of Florida out of tuition
0:47:21.440.440	0:47:22.500.500	rates because what do you mean a
0:47:22.500.500	0:47:23.380.380	hundred thousand dollars sounds about
0:47:23.380.380	0:47:26.100.099	right yeah but we're looking at so one
0:47:26.100.099	0:47:27.660.659	this is for twenty eight thousand six
0:47:27.660.659	0:47:28.980.980	hundred and fifty nine dollars out of
0:47:28.980.980	0:47:30.240.239	state correct thirty thousand dollars
0:47:30.240.239	0:47:32.400.400	yep so one this is the out-of-state
0:47:32.400.400	0:47:33.840.840	tuition yes that's what number two
0:47:33.840.840	0:47:35.400.400	hold on this is the sticker price
0:47:35.400.400	0:47:37.080.079	nobody pays this for school you've got
0:47:37.080.079	0:47:38.280.280	Pell grants you've got different types
0:47:38.280.280	0:47:39.340.340	of student aids you've got tons of
0:47:39.340.340	0:47:40.440.440	different scholarship initiatives very
0:47:40.440.440	0:47:41.940.940	very very very very very few people so
0:47:41.940.940	0:47:43.800.800	actually pay right but you're trying to
0:47:43.800.800	0:47:45.760.760	make me wrong so I know I paid that
0:47:45.760.760	0:47:48.840.840	price right so I paid back my loan so
0:47:48.840.840	0:47:49.740.739	you're not going to convince me that
0:47:49.740.739	0:47:51.100.099	very few people are paying this my
0:47:51.100.099	0:47:52.440.440	sisters paid that price and they paid
0:47:52.440.440	0:47:54.600.599	back though so you're just saying like
0:47:54.600.599	0:47:57.240.239	and yes my granted my school was more
0:47:57.240.239	0:47:59.280.280	expensive it was I think thirty five
0:47:59.280.280	0:48:00.600.599	thousand dollars there you go the
0:48:00.600.599	0:48:02.280.280	average twenty so if we look at if we
0:48:02.280.280	0:48:03.900.900	look at just say you were right to this
0:48:03.900.900	0:48:05.840.840	so fifty one percent you're not going to
0:48:05.840.840	0:48:07.560.559	get hurt so fifty one percent of
0:48:07.560.559	0:48:08.980.980	bachelor's degrees graduate with an
0:48:08.980.980	0:48:10.440.440	average of twenty nine thousand four
0:48:10.440.440	0:48:11.840.840	hundred dollars in student loan debt
0:48:11.840.840	0:48:14.280.280	right so that's only fifty one percent
0:48:14.280.280	0:48:16.020.019	of people I guess that acquired that and
0:48:16.020.019	0:48:17.280.280	then their average debt is about twenty
0:48:17.280.280	0:48:18.860.860	nine thousand four hundred are you I
0:48:18.860.860	0:48:19.860.860	don't get what the point is of you
0:48:19.860.860	0:48:21.820.820	doing this the point are you trying to
0:48:21.820.820	0:48:25.060.059	say the point I'm saying is that one the
0:48:25.060.059	0:48:26.420.420	sticker price for an out-of-state
0:48:26.420.420	0:48:27.840.840	tuition school is not what I would use
0:48:27.840.840	0:48:29.020.019	as the median price you need to pay for
0:48:29.020.019	0:48:30.380.380	four-year degree number one number two
0:48:30.380.380	0:48:31.940.940	very few people actually hey we didn't
0:48:31.940.940	0:48:33.380.380	talk about that because I said this is
0:48:33.380.380	0:48:36.280.280	the median price I said it is utterly
0:48:36.280.280	0:48:38.640.639	absurd that people are spending one
0:48:38.640.639	0:48:40.240.239	hundred thousand dollars to come out
0:48:40.240.239	0:48:41.980.980	with a degree we weren't talking about
0:48:41.980.980	0:48:43.540.539	we weren't debating the median price
0:48:43.540.539	0:48:44.800.800	sure but number one you're going for
0:48:44.800.800	0:48:46.340.340	out-of-state if I'm in-state my tuition
0:48:46.340.340	0:48:47.560.559	is six thousand four hundred dollars I'm
0:48:47.560.559	0:48:49.460.460	getting literally said out-of-state I
0:48:49.460.460	0:48:51.460.460	actually said out-of-state yeah but why do I
0:48:51.460.460	0:48:54.040.039	care about that at that number I don't
0:48:54.040.039	0:48:55.300.300	get where you're going the point of
0:48:55.300.300	0:48:59.260.260	saying that there are individuals that
0:48:59.260.260	0:49:00.880.880	are going to school that are spending
0:49:00.880.880	0:49:02.800.800	one hundred thousand dollars right I
0:49:02.800.800	0:49:04.460.460	don't know what to do with any gender
0:49:04.460.460	0:49:05.740.739	studies but we're talking about yeah
0:49:05.740.739	0:49:06.640.639	I'm sure and I could probably find
0:49:06.640.639	0:49:07.780.780	people the million dollars student loan
0:49:07.780.780	0:49:08.860.860	debt they got an even dumber degree
0:49:08.860.860	0:49:09.820.820	than general studies and basketball
0:49:09.820.820	0:49:11.500.500	whatever but in general that's not
0:49:11.500.500	0:49:12.620.619	the cost of a college degree and in
0:49:12.620.619	0:49:14.140.139	general college degrees confer huge
0:49:14.140.139	0:49:15.200.199	wage premiums under the people that
0:49:15.200.199	0:49:16.460.460	earn them these are like oh they don't
0:49:16.460.460	0:49:17.840.840	and that is the reason why you have so
0:49:17.840.840	0:49:19.540.539	many young women that are and this is
0:49:19.540.539	0:49:22.040.039	this is why you know I think that what
0:49:22.040.039	0:49:25.540.539	you actually do here is harmful and I'm

0:49:31.880.880	0:49:32.960.960	single thing that you're saying sounds
0:49:32.960.960	0:49:34.120.119	really good on like a culture war
0:49:34.120.119	0:49:35.600.599	perspective when you look at an actual
0:49:35.600.599	0:49:36.760.760	economic perspective when you look at
0:49:36.760.760	0:49:38.420.420	actual firms that hire people and when
0:49:38.420.420	0:49:39.660.659	you look at the actual median wages
0:49:39.660.659	0:49:40.820.820	converted people that even have some

0:50:47.620.619	0:50:49.240.239	overwhelming majority of people I'm
0:50:49.240.239	0:50:50.620.619	so glad people in the chat are saying
0:50:50.620.619	0:50:52.360.360	that I am right because overwhelming
0:50:52.360.360	0:50:53.620.619	amount of people are shocked when the
0:50:53.620.619	0:50:55.300.300	real world then smacks them in the face
0:50:55.300.300	0:50:57.860.860	and that lie that dream that was sold
0:50:57.860.860	0:50:59.240.239	to you by your guidance counselors in

0:51:05.860.860	0:51:08.140.139	like to say do not disrespect people that
0:51:08.140.139	0:51:09.360.360	go to trade school because I just
0:51:09.360.360	0:51:11.220.219	I'm not disrespecting people that go to trade school
0:51:11.220.219	0:51:11.960.960	what are you talking about
0:51:11.960.960	0:51:14.040.039	wait why are we virtue signaling on this
0:51:14.040.039	0:51:15.080.079	because you shouldn't go to trade school
0:51:15.080.079	0:51:16.420.420	because if you go to college you make more money
0:51:16.420.420	0:51:18.060.059	that's not true it's just not true
0:51:18.060.059	0:51:18.980.980	what do you mean it's not true
0:51:18.980.980	0:51:20.280.280	that's not true you can like quite
0:51:20.280.280	0:51:21.640.639	literally you can be the person that
0:51:21.640.639	0:51:23.400.400	goes to trade school and you will make
0:51:23.400.400	0:51:25.640.639	so much money doing jobs that actually
0:51:25.640.639	0:51:27.380.380	bring value to society
0:51:27.380.380	0:51:29.240.239	computer programmers don't bring value to
0:51:29.240.239	0:51:30.540.539	the society mechanical engineers
0:51:30.540.539	0:51:31.680.679	don't bring value to society
0:51:31.680.679	0:51:34.520.519	if you want to be a mechanical engineer
0:51:34.520.519	0:51:37.420.420	yes but if you know what you want to do
0:51:37.420.420	0:51:38.220.219	and you know you want to be a chemical
0:51:38.220.219	0:51:39.700.699	engineer I'm not saying nobody should go
0:51:39.700.699	0:51:42.420.420	to college I'm saying too many people are going to college
0:51:42.420.420	0:51:44.100.099	they are putting themselves in debt
0:51:44.100.099	0:51:46.260.260	for things that they don't even know what they want to do
0:51:46.260.260	0:51:48.020.019	and they get out into the world and they can't make any money
0:51:48.020.019	0:51:50.340.340	and it is a struggle and they are they are suffering
0:51:50.340.340	0:51:54.260.260	I'm watching these girls I know that people on the right like to mock these girls
0:51:54.260.260	0:51:57.060.059	who are crying on tick tock who are saying like you know
0:51:57.060.059	0:51:59.860.860	I got out of college and here's how no money that I can make I didn't know this
0:51:59.860.860	0:52:01.620.619	I actually feel bad for those girls
0:52:01.620.619	0:52:03.940.940	because we have to just stop lying to people about what college is
0:52:03.940.940	0:52:05.060.059	it's been inflated
0:52:05.060.059	0:52:06.980.980	you are you look at like black community
0:52:09.700.699	0:52:12.420.420	reasons why women are starting to out earn black men is because they're going to
0:52:12.420.420	0:52:14.500.500	school and they're going to college and they're actually getting degrees and
0:52:14.500.500	0:52:16.500.500	they're getting real careers isn't that one of the biggest contributing factors
0:52:16.500.500	0:52:18.100.099	I don't know that
0:52:18.100.099	0:52:20.580.579	okay um
0:52:20.580.579	0:52:21.700.699	okay final question
0:52:21.700.699	0:52:24.100.099	I think by the way I think women by the way
0:52:24.100.099	0:52:27.540.539	all across the board are graduating at higher rates than men
0:52:27.540.539	0:52:32.020.019	but I I do want to say what because I don't make a point about what you do
0:52:32.020.019	0:52:37.300.300	because I did see that you did you did a video and you were like taking the side of hoes like
0:52:37.300.300	0:52:41.540.539	you saw this Candace did she say selfish I must have misheard
0:52:41.540.539	0:52:46.980.980	a selfish should mention not marry her holy oh I'm gonna get triggered I feel like I might
0:52:46.980.980	0:52:50.020.019	lose my mind this episode I agree that these people can be cringe sometimes but you're saying
0:52:50.020.019	0:52:56.740.739	she's a narcissistic that men shouldn't marry you're taking that so far it's a partnership it's
0:52:56.740.739	0:52:59.700.699	a bond it's forever but there's no difference between dating there is a difference there is a
0:52:59.700.699	0:53:03.460.460	difference you just ignored it because you've got a dialogue tree and a narrative you want to push
0:53:03.460.460	0:53:06.900.900	you're not going to engage with anything she's saying she gave you a perfectly legitimate answer
0:53:06.900.900	0:53:10.340.340	it is a more permanent form of relationship it's solidified by law it's not something you just
0:53:10.340.340	0:53:13.860.860	walk away from her breakup from it's a commitment ideally for lifetimes she gave you a good answer
0:53:13.860.860	0:53:16.260.260	you just don't like to hear because it was a good one and you wouldn't expect a random
0:53:16.260.260	0:53:19.220.219	OnlyFans girl to give you one and now you're surprised that a bunch of girls that you thought
0:53:19.220.219	0:53:22.180.179	were just gonna be titty bimbos are actually giving you a run for your money
0:53:22.180.179	0:53:23.700.699	you're still talking okay
0:53:23.700.699	0:53:33.620.619	I'm not bashing hold on I'm not bashing the women are low value that they're gonna
0:53:33.620.619	0:53:38.180.179	have worse relationships and lives they're gonna be unhappy I'm not bashing them absolutely
0:53:38.180.179	0:53:41.620.619	fascinating to see how someone's minds can be so warped you know in the same way that I think
0:53:41.620.619	0:53:46.660.659	it's fascinating I've been respectful and listening to you know your lifestyle no you're not respectful
0:53:47.460.460	0:53:52.260.260	I'm actually sitting down with hoes on the whatever podcast and you did you were being so rude to that
0:53:52.260.260	0:53:56.580.579	lady that made the tick tock oh my god all right but the point is is that you then went through
0:53:56.580.579	0:54:03.060.059	you called her a bitch you you then went through this video and just tried to justify these lifestyles
0:54:03.060.059	0:54:06.340.340	right I don't think I was trying to justify the lifestyle what I was doing was I was fighting it
0:54:06.340.340	0:54:09.940.940	back against the insane judgment from one side to the other we live in America people should be able
0:54:09.940.940	0:54:13.300.300	to live the lifestyles they want and that's not harming other people I think everybody has the right
0:54:13.300.300	0:54:18.820.820	to pursue and I just want to say to that to people that are watching this to anybody that you follow
0:54:18.820.820	0:54:25.780.780	literally you should take measure and really ask yourself whether or not that person is telling
0:54:25.780.780	0:54:31.140.139	you that stuff because they believe it or whether or not that person is telling you something that
0:54:31.140.139	0:54:34.340.340	ultimately it feels good because then it means that you can remove yourself from responsibility oh
0:54:34.340.340	0:54:38.420.420	I see yeah it's fine I can be a ho whatever whatever whatever but it's going to lead you to misery
0:54:38.420.420	0:54:43.700.699	right and so I tell people you know I've seen a lot I've been through a lot I've lived through a lot
0:54:43.700.699	0:54:48.020.019	very proud of myself where I've ended up and I'm trying to provide people the shortcuts and I'm trying to
0:54:48.020.019	0:54:52.500.500	tell you that yes I understand that as a young woman if you jump on to only fans you can make
0:54:52.500.500	0:54:58.420.420	money and you can make money very quickly but I am also telling you that if you do that you will the
0:54:58.420.420	0:55:03.220.219	overwhelming majority of people can you find an exception sure will regret that sort of a lifestyle
0:55:03.220.219	0:55:10.260.260	and to these young people that are listening to you doing the like yo love it makes you happy
0:55:10.260.260	0:55:15.300.300	don't I am telling you like throw this out it is trash like I agree you shouldn't do only fans
0:55:15.300.300	0:55:19.780.780	as a young person you should not be aspiring to open relationships you should go to college and
0:55:19.780.780	0:55:24.260.260	get a degree instead somebody that's just holding up a you know a mirror to tell you that you're
0:55:24.260.260	0:55:30.740.739	great and you're doing amazing like it's it you don't need that you're not great you can do better
0:55:30.740.739	0:55:37.860.860	right you your life is worth more there are rules that work college is every single person that I
0:55:37.860.860	0:55:41.780.780	went to school with is not using the degrees that they paid what did you what did you go to
0:55:41.780.780	0:55:47.540.539	actually what did I a journalism isn't that what you're doing right now what do you mean like
0:55:47.540.539	0:55:52.820.820	journalism stuff you probably don't know my back story so because my family was poor I had to take
0:55:52.820.820	0:55:56.820.820	out loans to go to school my mom didn't even graduate high school so wait what if your family's
0:55:56.820.820	0:56:04.120.119	poor why would you have to take out loans to go to school what I just told you if your family's
0:56:04.120.119	0:56:08.200.199	poor why would you take out loans to go to school why would I have to take out loans to go to
0:56:08.200.199	0:56:14.440.440	what do you mean I have to take out loans my family can't afford to pay to put me through school
0:56:15.240.239	0:56:19.560.559	hold on was your family actually poor or did you just lie what are you talking about if you go to
0:56:19.560.559	0:56:23.240.239	school and your family has a low gross income you fill out you fill out the fafsa and the fafsa is
0:56:23.240.239	0:56:26.920.920	going to award you a ton of federal aid assuming that you don't actually have the gross income from
0:56:26.920.920	0:56:30.600.599	your parents actually go to school so if your parents are super poor I don't know why you had to pay
0:56:30.600.599	0:56:35.160.159	full out-of-state tuition to go to a university did you think what do you mean did I lie I don't know how
0:56:35.160.159	0:56.000	if your parents are poor if they have a low gross income how do you not qualify for the fafsa okay
0:56.000	0:56:45.880.880	well all I can say to you is that I had to pay 35 almost my school cost more and by the end of it
0:56:45.880.880	0:56:49.640.639	and I'm also including because then I defaulted on my student loans and I had to pay it back so now
0:56:49.640.639	0:56:53.640.639	I had to pay back the bank for not being able to pay them on time so this doesn't something doesn't
0:56:53.640.639	0:56:59.080.079	match up okay well I'm telling you the truth so I don't know what to say I did you fill out a fafsa
0:56:59.080.079	0:57:02.520.519	yeah well I also didn't have parents that could help me fill it out I was a first-generation college
0:57:02.520.519	0:57:06.600.599	student my dad uh you didn't have a school the same school counselor you told these people to
0:57:06.600.599	0:57:09.960.960	ignore you didn't talk to one of them and say hey I don't know like if you're trying to shame me
0:57:09.960.960	0:57:15.960.960	for not I'm not trying to shame you I'm just like I don't get your point here like I'm telling you
0:57:15.960.960	0:57:19.240.239	the truth I there's I have no reason to lie about this my point is you had about having a hundred
0:57:19.240.239	0:57:22.680.679	thousand dollars in debt you told these people not to talk to counselors and you said that your family
0:57:22.680.679	0:57:25.880.880	is poor so you went to school for journalism on an out-of-state tuition you didn't fill out a fafsa for any
0:57:25.880.880	0:57:30.040.039	student aid I'm just saying like what what is your point in saying am I lying about it like
0:57:30.040.039	0:57:33.160.159	because I don't understand how you came from a poor family and didn't fill out a fafsa and get a
0:57:33.160.159	0:57:38.680.679	ton of student aid I did fill out fafsa and they didn't give you anything they I I maybe got in
0:57:38.680.679	0:57:43.720.719	terms of a I remember getting a pell grant that was like eight thousand dollars okay but I'm telling
0:57:43.720.719	0:57:48.520.519	the truth so I just I just want to be clear I'm telling the truth about my life like I don't know
0:57:48.520.519	0:57:53.240.239	what to say to you and and I don't get why what was your question of saying like why did you take out
0:57:53.240.239	0:57:58.520.519	a loan if you were poor I don't understand that question like I don't get it because the implication is
0:57:58.520.519	0:58:02.280.280	that if you've pulled out if you filled out a fafsa your parents gross income is used to heavily
0:58:02.280.280	0:58:04.760.760	determine the amount of student aid you'll qualify for and you're coming from an incredibly poor
0:58:04.760.760	0:58:07.960.960	family you should get a ton that's not what happened maybe that circumstance and please
0:58:07.960.960	0:58:12.120.119	guys jump in the chat like if you if somebody said destiny that's stupid I don't I don't think they
0:58:12.120.119	0:58:15.960.960	just give you free college if you're poor I that's not my experience did you go to university did you
0:58:15.960.960	0:58:19.720.719	get free money um I did and I got some free money but I had to get married for it because my parents
0:58:19.720.719	0:58:23.720.719	had a high gross income but a lot of debt so I didn't qualify for the fafsa so I had to get married at 19.
0:58:23.720.719	0:58:28.920.920	I yeah I paid back my student loans all by myself so I could tell you that I spent over six figures
0:58:28.920.920	0:58:35.480.480	paying back my student loans to attend the University of Rhode Island and that is the truth
0:58:35.480.480	0:58:41.800.800	I don't mean and no I am not lying my family does not have any money okay um my parents don't own
0:58:41.800.800	0:58:45.480.480	anything I don't I mean we don't even have a house like we don't even own obviously I don't mean like
0:58:45.480.480	0:58:50.440.440	we're homeless I meant like as in like my family does didn't even own property so it's like no I'm not
0:58:50.440.440	0:58:54.680.679	lying about that so I don't I don't know what rather we were chasing there isn't the issue here
0:58:54.680.679	0:58:57.560.559	then why would you go also I understand if you have to leave anything because he said you had a heart
0:58:57.560.559	0:59:00.920.920	out at three and we're at three or six so all right I don't understand why you would go to an out-of-state
0:59:00.920.920	0:59:05.640.639	school for a journalism degree and then turn around and blame colleges for being bad when it feels like
0:59:05.640.639	0:59:10.360.360	I'm not blaming colleges for being bad I am telling people the truth so that they can avoid making some
0:59:10.360.360	0:59:14.120.119	of the mistakes which is don't go to an out-of-state school for a degree that might not
0:59:14.120.119	0:59:18.520.519	for a higher amount of money I probably should have yes I'm sorry that I was you know 17 years
0:59:18.520.519	0:59:23.480.480	old and I didn't have parents that were able to provide the economic you know the economic advising
0:59:23.480.480	0:59:28.680.679	of course that would have been smarter and my sister you know two of my sisters went in state and but
0:59:28.680.679	0:59:32.920.920	they still had really heavy loans so I don't know about this fafsa magic thing that you think happens
0:59:32.920.920	0:59:40.120.119	then my sister paid uh about twenty thousand dollars a year um when she went in state so I just I don't I
0:59:40.120.119	0:59:43.480.480	don't know what I don't I just don't know what you're talking about at all with that because all of my
0:59:43.480.480	0:59:47.960.960	sisters we all had to pay loans we my older sister just finished off paying her loan so I don't know
0:59:49.320.320	0:59:53.080.079	I just don't know what you're talking about the fafsa magic button maybe I if I if honestly if I
0:59:53.080.079	0:59:58.440.440	missed the fafsa magic button and they were gonna pay for everything then maybe I am just really
0:59:58.440.440	1:00:03.400.400	stupid and I had no idea yeah I don't know listen I'll be honest maybe it's like a difference in
1:00:03.400.400	1:00:06.600.599	like areas or people that we talk to maybe because the high school I went to was like very oriented
1:00:06.600.599	1:00:09.320.320	and trying to get you to college but when I was going to college like I think fafsa stuff was like
1:00:09.320.320	1:00:13.400.400	the most important thing like student aid but I did I did I did fill it out I don't know if
1:00:13.400.400	1:00:16.040.039	it's because we had my family had multiple children and we were all going to I don't know
1:00:16.040.039	1:00:20.360.360	what the circumstances but I'm just telling you the truth is that I paid for my college and
1:00:20.360.360	1:00:24.760.760	I do try to tell people that if you don't know what you want to do spending tens of thousands of
1:00:24.760.760	1:00:28.760.760	dollars trying to figure that out is probably not the right move like you can always go to college
1:00:28.760.760	1:00:33.560.559	you can go later you know try to figure out what you're good at get an internship I hire people
1:00:33.560.559	1:00:36.680.679	that are right out of high school because I don't just believe this like you know there was a
1:00:36.680.679	1:00:39.720.719	young woman that now works for me who's like I don't really know what I'm doing here I kind of just
1:00:39.720.719	1:00:44.520.519	want to be a mom I was like do not spend and her out of tuition rate was fifty thousand dollars
1:00:44.520.519	1:00:49.160.159	for an in for a Tennessee school okay and so I hired her I mean I'm not telling people like I said I
1:00:49.160.159	1:00:53.240.239	tell people how I actually live and what I actually believe and I don't know and I don't know that you
1:00:53.240.239	1:00:59.400.400	do that like don't don't don't justify women acting like whores well I don't justify trying to
1:00:59.400.400	1:01:03.320.320	prescribe lifestyles to people what don't justify trying to prescribe lifestyles to people it's not
1:01:03.320.320	1:01:07.400.400	prescribing a lifestyle when somebody said that they would be happy not having kids you're like oh she
1:01:07.400.400	1:01:12.520.519	sounds like a conceited bitch or something that's not what she said that was that's not what she said
1:01:12.520.519	1:01:16.040.039	and I can tell you exactly what she said she was got to go on vacation I said there was absolutely
1:01:16.040.039	1:01:21.560.559	no reason to make a comment that suggests that people she was actually being insulting people
1:01:21.560.559	1:01:26.440.440	that had kids she'd and she it wasn't just one video she makes multiple videos about how great life
1:01:26.440.440	1:01:31.400.400	is if you don't have kids if I was making videos with my kids saying about how great life is if you
1:01:31.400.400	1:01:35.720.719	just you know stop being a loser and get married you people would come after you because people hate
1:01:35.720.719	1:01:39.400.400	the traditional lifestyle on display wait but that's literally what you guys say get married
1:01:39.400.400	1:01.000	have kids that's the only way to go otherwise you're a loser no we do not that is you're just
1:01.000	1:01:47.160.159	making up words that have never come out of my mouth so wait so if somebody said if there was a young
1:01:47.160.159	1:01:50.760.760	woman and she's like I'm 20 I think I'm gonna go to a career um and and be a whatever I don't think
1:01:50.760.760	1:01:53.560.559	I want to have a family I don't think life's for me you would say okay well that's fine you should
1:01:53.560.559	1:01.000	make that choice no I would say that's completely normal at 20 years old that's uh wait wait so then they
1:01.000	1:02:00.200.199	should change their opinion later on what if she was 25 or 30 she's like no I don't think I want to have
1:02:00.200.199	1:02:05.560.559	kids would you be okay that's fine if she was a 20 year old person and she was saying that I don't think that I want to
1:02:05.560.559	1:02:11.160.159	have kids then what I would say is that's pretty typical because you're 20 years old and you're
1:02:11.160.159	1:02:16.120.119	you haven't yet had the biology thing happen to you which like when they say that your biological
1:02:16.120.119	1:02:19.080.079	clock starts ticking it's very real when you get into your mid-20s you have a totally different
1:02:19.080.079	1:02:22.520.519	feeling so if a woman is 25 or 30 and says I don't think I want to have kids I think I like my career
1:02:22.520.519	1:02:26.360.360	I'm going to stick with it you'd say okay that's fine it's your choice yeah as long as that person isn't
1:02:26.360.360	1:02:31.160.159	trying to and by the way I think that that person would probably be it would be unusual like it wouldn't
1:02:31.160.159	1:02:36.200.199	be the majority of women I think do want to have families and want to aspire to family and that's
1:02:36.200.199	1:02:42.520.519	fine but when you try to create a brand of it and you say things like oh well you know if you have
1:02:42.520.519	1:02:46.120.119	kids then you can't just smoke pot and stay in bed and be naked all day this is actually something that
1:02:46.120.119	1:02:52.600.599	like Seth Rogen just said okay what you're doing there is you're actually trying to you're 30 how
1:02:52.600.599	1:02:58.840.840	old you're 35 years old yep okay so what what are you what is that what do you what do I do like if
1:02:58.840.840	1:03:02.520.519	you were 20 well let's say I'm a millionaire I travel the world I get to research to talk about
1:03:02.520.519	1:03:06.040.039	whatever I want I get cool people like you and other people I get to I live in Miami and a high
1:03:06.040.039	1:03:09.480.480	rise for five dollars a month I mean I I think my life is pretty okay I mean what do you but no but
1:03:09.480.480	1:03:15.400.400	I'm saying like what are you doing when you're trying to sell to people that you know being a hoe is
1:03:15.400.400	1:03:20.200.199	cool smoking pot saying I don't necessarily think are you going to age out of that what I try what I
1:03:20.200.199	1:03:25.640.639	thought you're a 35 year old man right like you know and you're kind of doing the like I'm a college
1:03:25.640.639	1:03.000	dorm kid and I'm trying to make everything sound cool but I just want to point out the fact that
1:03.000	1:03:31.960.960	you're a 35 year old man and your words should matter and they should they should have weight
1:03:31.960.960	1:03:37.640.639	like you like I said if you were 20 I'd be like I get it when you're 35 you know say things with
1:03:37.640.639	1:03.000	conviction say things that have many things with conviction you know and like when I asked you
1:03.000	1:03:44.040.039	what would you recommend to women at 25 and 30 I didn't just start rambling about what a 20 year old
1:03:44.040.039	1:03:47.160.159	should do and how biological blah blah blah I would say exactly what I would tell a woman at 25
1:03:47.160.159	1:03:51.880.880	I know but your behavior and and and I will appreciate that people that are younger won't understand what I'm
1:03:51.880.880	1:03:58.520.519	saying until you hit 35 which is I'm gonna be 35 this year okay you're acting like you're a college
1:03:58.520.519	1:04:02.120.119	dorm kid yeah and you're catty insults towards people online make you seem like a high school
1:04:02.120.119	1:04:05.800.800	mean girl I mean like what do you mean like we all have our things but you're selling to them things
1:04:05.800.800	1:04:10.280.280	that you know aren't good so what do you think if you were a 25 year old like when I'm on the
1:04:10.280.280	1:04:14.600.599	whatever podcast and I'm surrounded by women that are in their 20s and they're saying like you
1:04:14.600.599	1:04:18.520.519	know the whole life is good the reason why I said to that girl that I'm going to pray for you
1:04:18.520.519	1:04:21.720.719	is because I know that she's going to have a different perspective when she's older so I don't
1:04:21.720.719	1:04:25.800.800	I'm not upset by that I don't feel like that needs to be attacked when that woman when that young when
1:04:25.800.800	1:04:29.160.159	those young girls are around me and we're talking about all of these topics when I'm sitting with
1:04:29.160.159	1:04:35.560.559	a 35 year old man okay and you and and you know better okay what do you think I'm selling people
1:04.000	1:04:42.280.280	what I said when you were defending the lifestyle of being a hoe why are you doing that I don't think
1:04:42.280.280	1:04:47.480.480	I defend the lifestyle of being you did you did a whole video basically saying that none of my points of
1:04:47.480.480	1:04:51.640.639	me trying to tell these women that they essentially you can do something better you don't have to sell
1:04:51.640.639	1:04:56.600.599	your body this was your like snazzy video come back to it why are you making a comeback yes you can
1:04:56.600.599	1:05:00.520.519	make a video and be like why can't someone do heroin but why would you as a 35 year old man want to
1:05:00.520.519	1:05:05.560.559	sell something to someone or make it seem okay or cool or relevant when you know it's harmful to them
1:05:05.560.559	1:05:11.080.079	I don't get that because of your age yeah so I don't understand I don't know what your takeaway from
1:05:11.080.079	1:05:15.080.079	the video was if there are researchers that give you like talking points my videos but generally what I talk
1:05:15.080.079	1:05:18.200.199	about is when it comes to lifestyle you have to analyze both sides of things if you grow up
1:05:18.200.199	1:05:21.240.239	incredibly religiously conservative and you are like shamed out of sex and you don't have sex
1:05:21.240.239	1:05.000	with anybody your whole life because you're super you know hyper uh cognizant of your virginity and
1:05.000	1:05:27.880.880	all of these like weird things and that's like coming from an unhealthy external place to say oh well maybe
1:05:27.880.880	1:05:31.960.960	that's worth exploring on the flip side if you grow up like hyper liberal and you've fucked like 20 guys
1:05:31.960.960	1:05:34.920.920	by the time you're you know 20 years old and you just want to bang everybody and you've got like
1:05:34.920.920	1:05:37.960.960	weird associations with men and everything I'd say hey you should probably slow down it's probably not
1:05:37.960.960	1:05:42.280.280	healthy um I just encourage people to like explore honestly to have like conversations with themselves with their
1:05:42.280.280	1:05:45.240.239	parents uh could be with priests could be with therapists could be whatever and to kind of
1:05:45.240.239	1:05:47.880.880	figure out like what works for them and don't get pushed into one direction from a culture side
1:05:47.880.880	1:05.000	it could be the left encouraging people to be way too promiscuous or it could be the right for
1:05.000	1:05:54.120.119	people that are shaming people for being promiscuous and saying that well this one lifestyle of family
1:05:54.120.119	1:05:57.640.639	stuff is going to biologically be suited towards you as you get older I think both of these are equally
1:05:57.640.639	1:06:00.840.840	stupid because it just pushes people in the other direction so you don't believe in anything
1:06:00.840.840	1:06:03.960.960	is what you're saying is that what you got from that well you're not committing I believe in actually
1:06:03.960.960	1:06:08.600.599	thinking for yourself that's what I think I think that every human being roughly exists in this like paradigm
1:06:08.600.599	1:06:12.280.280	where if you fuck a hundred people by the time you're 20 probably not healthy if you've never
1:06:12.280.280	1:06:16.200.199	had sex before and you're 30 probably not healthy and that you should probably like try to gravitate
1:06:16.200.199	1:06.000	towards what are like human norms and then what are things that make you happy depending on your
1:06.000	1:06:21.880.880	culture depending on your geography and then you kind of like explore in there and don't be shamed
1:06:21.880.880	1:06:24.840.840	out of exploring from one side to the other don't be pushed into something because somebody like
1:06:24.840.840	1:06:28.120.119	Candace Owens or somebody like Stephen Bunnell tells you that you have to do a particular thing but
1:06:28.120.119	1:06:31.800.800	just like kind of I don't tell people that they have to do a particular thing but if I see somebody that's
1:06:31.800.800	1:06:34.920.920	doing heroin I'm not going to be like you know it is whatever and it's just like whatever you're just
1:06:34.920.920	1:06:40.680.679	doing heroin is comparable to recreational sex I am I am quite frankly I actually think a woman
1:06:40.680.679	1:06:44.920.920	as the one that I sat across from when you were critiquing this video who says that she slept with
1:06:44.920.920	1:06:50.440.440	up to what was it 20 men per night yeah it's just as bad and I know that that has to be hurting her
1:06:50.440.440	1:06:54.120.119	soul so I look at her as a human being hurting her soul what if she just has a different lifestyle
1:06:54.120.119	1:06:58.520.519	she doesn't completely no she don't you know no she what do you mean you know she's she's telling you
1:06:58.520.519	1:07:02.840.840	she was very honest actually and that's why I appreciate her because she was very honest that for her
1:07:02.840.840	1:07:07.320.320	it is just about money okay but when I see that individual when a young woman is saying that she'll
1:07:07.320.320	1:07:13.480.480	sleep and see up to 10 to 20 clients per night that's a broken individual and it's just when you
1:07:13.480.480	1:07:19.240.239	see somebody who says that you know they're doing heroin or doing this they don't need the guy the
1:07:19.240.239	1:07:24.360.360	cool guy at the party be like yeah man it's whatever like it's like no you actually like structure you
1:07:24.360.360	1:07:29.480.480	need somebody to say to you you don't have to do this there you there's so much better potential
1:07:29.480.480	1:07:34.600.599	within you you are young you have your entire life ahead of you let's figure out what it is that
1:07:34.600.599	1:07:39.800.800	you're great at I understand the economic concerns it's a really tough economy and it's easy money
1:07:39.800.800	1:07:44.520.519	but there's other things that you can do to make money that will give you better self-value and so
1:07:44.520.519	1:07:51.080.079	that's why I say that I think that what you're doing as a 35 year old man is you're you're lying
1:07:51.080.079	1:07:55.240.239	you're just lying do you think I'm telling women on average that fucking 20 guys when you make videos
1:07:55.240.239	1:07.000	and you're replying to conservatives who are rightfully saying that this lifestyle is not
1:07.000	1:08:03.880.880	good which should be abundantly clear to every single person yeah what you're trying to do is
1:08:03.880.880	1:08.000	lie in a clever way you're and ultimately like I said if you were 20 I'd be fine with it but
1:08.000	1:08:11.560.559	when first of all I don't know why if I was 20 why that would make you because when you're what
1:08:11.560.559	1:08.000	because because you'd have the same influence in your audience regardless number one not developed
1:08.000	1:08:19.320.319	when you're 20 number two so what your brain's always developing as you grow no your brain develops
1:08:19.320.319	1:08:23.400.399	when you're 25 26 years old and so when you see a 20 year old and they have a bunch of positions
1:08:23.400.399	1:08:27.640.640	I don't hold them to it I think you have time you're gonna change life experience I think you
1:08:27.640.640	1:08:30.440.439	do grow but like literally factually I know if you want to google this but your brain develops when
1:08:30.440.439	1:08:33.880.880	you're 25 20 if you really want to google it factually the 25 number came from one study that
1:08:33.880.880	1:08.000	was done like 30 years ago where they only measure brain development up to 25 and the reality is the
1:08.000	1:08:39.560.560	plasticity of your brain and every other structure your brain continues to grow into your 30s that's
1:08:39.560.560	1:08:42.440.439	technically where that number comes from it's not true you can look it up later if you want the 25 26
1:08:42.440.439	1:08:46.760.760	thing is a misnumber it's not actually true well like I said if you were if you were 20 I would accept but
1:08:46.760.760	1:08:52.200.199	there there is such a thing as objective truth and people that shirk and and pretend that there's not
1:08:52.200.199	1:08:57.160.159	and like everybody can do whatever they want it's it's yeah no about about things that are harmful
1:08:57.160.159	1:09:01.400.399	to people like objectively speaking so wait what is the upper bounds on recreational sex that you
1:09:01.400.399	1:09:05.080.079	think is harmful or not harmful what when you're selling your body and sleeping with old i'm not
1:09:05.080.079	1:09:08.200.199	asking that i'm just saying what is the upper bounds on recreational sex that you think is like
1:09:09.240.239	1:09:12.920.920	like healthy for a human being like if you go past this you're like clearly over the line
1:09:13.640.640	1:09:18.040.039	i'm not gonna say to a person this is a number that you should sleep with and this makes you
1:09:18.040.039	1:09:20.520.520	well don't accuse me of believing in nothing i'm not sticking out of position where you're only
1:09:20.520.520	1:09:24.760.760	talking about the whatever yeah i'm going to attack the same people that you do if some woman is on
1:09:24.760.760	1:09:27.800.800	saying like oh you can fuck 20 guys a night and do only because you're 18 i'm gonna say in general
1:09:27.800.800	1:09:31.160.159	that's a pretty wacky that's a pretty out there position i argue with tons of people over this
1:09:31.160.159	1:09:35.160.159	i don't encourage people what is what is the what are you trying to do what purpose are you trying
1:09:35.160.159	1:09:39.720.720	to fulfill when you as a 35 year old man see me sitting down with these young women trying to say you
1:09:39.720.720	1:09:43.720.720	don't need to do this you didn't have to do this for money and you like attack it and try to be like
1:09:43.720.720	1:09:47.800.800	canis is just a bitch or like whatever like she's blah blah blah she's just being a high school mean
1:09:47.800.800	1:09:52.920.920	girl it's like no i am trying to tell these women that they are worth more and when i said to that
1:09:52.920.920	1:09:57.400.399	girl at the end of it which i don't believe you showed that i will pray for you and that you can
1:09:57.400.399	1:10:01.560.560	do you can do much more than this that came from the heart actually that is the most condescending
1:10:01.560.560	1:10:05.400.399	thing a religious person can say to a non-religious person i will pray for you okay you can deal with
1:10:05.400.399	1:10:10.040.039	your you know i i know that you went to a jesuit school and you've got some issues with somebody
1:10:10.040.039	1:10:14.040.039	why do you think i have issues but i meant that because i loved my high school i think it's fine
1:10:14.040.039	1:10:17.960.960	because for me to say like i meant what i said to her that i would pray for her like when she was
1:10:17.960.960	1:10:22.600.600	describing why she was very upfront you'll pray for her because i i did pray for her then do it
1:10:22.600.600	1:10:25.240.239	privately why do you need to tell her that you're only telling her that because you think you've got
1:10:25.240.239	1:10:28.840.840	such a condescension about you you've got such an air of superiority that you're going to pray for
1:10:28.840.840	1:10:33.640.640	air of superiority because i said i would god forbid someone says they'll pray that's obviously an air
1:10:33.640.640	1:10:37.880.880	of superiority because they're saying they're going to include you in their prayers well i mean like
1:10:37.880.880	1:10:41.960.960	literally something god forbid but like quite literally god forbid isn't there a whole story
1:10:41.960.960	1:10:45.400.399	of a lady going to a temple and quietly putting like two perchance or whatever the fuck into the
1:10:45.400.399	1:10:50.760.760	tray anti-christian rhetoric i don't know oh my god if you say if you say i'll pray for you it's
1:10:50.760.760	1:10:54.760.760	obviously you trying to be better it's like no what are you why are you even reacting to that i'll pray
1:10:54.760.760	1:10:59.480.479	for you i'll pray for everybody that listens and watches this show when people say that they're
1:10:59.480.479	1:11:03.480.479	going to pray for you they actually mean it you guys they just mean it there's no there's no
1:11:04.440.439	1:11:08.920.920	double entendre thing going on there and anybody that can go back and watch that clip you will see
1:11:08.920.920	1:11:14.040.039	that i was not speaking above her i actually genuinely respond to that girl because she was so honest and
1:11:14.040.039	1:11:18.840.840	she was so forthcoming she was i thought i actually wanted to do more stuff with her and we tried to
1:11:18.840.840	1:11:23.640.640	reach out with her because she wasn't trying to lie or trying to pretend like her you know her lifestyle
1:11:23.640.640	1:11:26.840.840	was for health she was clear that it was for money and she was like i'm not gonna lie this is why i do
1:11:26.840.840	1:11:31.560.560	this and i genuinely prayed for actually we we were not enemies that were sitting across the table so
1:11:31.560.560	1:11:36.280.279	no it was not condescending when i started preview it was a fact when i left i said i will keep you
1:11:36.280.279	1:11:41.720.720	in my prayers because i have in my heart i want to that girl in 10 years and know that she left that
1:11:41.720.720	1:11:46.120.119	field and she is able to speak to women that are still within it and think that they have to sell
1:11:46.120.119	1:11:50.680.680	their bodies for money and sleep with 10 men per night i am going to continue to pray for that young
1:11:50.680.680	1:11:56.280.279	woman because we need people who transform their lives to then show people that they can transform their
1:11:56.280.279	1:12:01.960.960	lives and it's not condescending to pray for anybody ever so okay i will pray for you too then
1:12:01.960.960	1:12:05.480.479	you should yeah you should okay i hope you pray for me i want you to include me in your prayers i want
1:12:05.480.479	1:12:09.080.079	every person watching this to include but i feel like our society's gotten so like anti-christ like oh
1:12:09.080.079	1:12:13.240.239	my god it's like no like i'll pray for you i will literally pray for every single person
1:12:13.240.239	1:12:19.160.159	that i i think needs a prayer and i felt like she needed a prayer like she's like she's she could be
1:12:19.160.159	1:12:23.960.960	there you know okay and you should watch it her and i had no like there was no beef between her and i
1:12:23.960.960	1:12:27.240.239	well you're telling me i did watch it and responded to it so i remember watching responding to you it
1:12:27.240.239	1:12:30.600.600	was going over the tick tock clip i don't remember praying is cool you guys just you know super dope
1:12:30.600.600	1:12:34.760.760	to pray telling other people you pray i'll pray for you look at that but it's not it's not cringe
1:12:34.760.760	1:12:37.320.319	there's nothing cringe about being a christian it's actually never said there was anything
1:12:37.320.319	1:12:41.480.479	about being a christian never said that at all the dopest thing you can do is pray in public
1:12:42.040.039	1:12:47.080.079	you know talk talk about your faith and your christianity there's nothing cringe about being
1:12:47.080.079	1:12:51.400.399	a christian there's nothing cringe about praying for others there's nothing cringe about getting on your
1:12:51.400.399	1:12:56.200.199	knees and praying to god when things are wrong i agree with your life and so that culture needs
1:12:56.200.199	1:13:00.120.119	to come back and i think that's totally everything that's going wrong in this society is by people
1:13:00.120.119	1:13:03.960.960	being like told that praying no there's nothing constant about it's dope it's cool about this is
1:13:03.960.960	1:13:09.400.399	this is the new uh this is the do you um this is the new wave well listen i disagree with everything
1:13:09.400.399	1:13:13.240.239	you say i think you're harmful to america you think i'm harmful that's fine i do appreciate you
1:13:13.240.239	1:13:18.680.680	harmful to america i just said that it is harmful when you do things like that um you know when you know
1:13:18.680.680	1:13:23.400.399	something's wrong and you still try to like find a way out and i just think that we can all acknowledge
1:13:23.400.399	1:13:26.920.920	that selling your body it's not a good thing and we should encourage people to do it okay if people
1:13:26.920.920	1:13:30.520.520	want to find you or if you want to direct them to anything that you're working on yeah listen if

1:13:46.120.119	1:13:51.400.399	mouth and not how it's being interpreted by other people and i know i've gotten so many emails people
1:13:51.400.399	1:13:55.960.960	saying that like they changed their lives uh because and because just so you know i am not better than
1:13:55.960.960	1:14:01.640.640	you like i say on my show the whole time i drank with the best of them i took the most liberal route
1:14:01.640.640	1:14:06.840.840	to conservatism that there ever was so i am i'm not better than anybody that i speak to i'm speaking from
1:14:06.840.840	1:14:11.640.640	the heart and trying to get people to avoid certain traps that you know i wish that i would have been
