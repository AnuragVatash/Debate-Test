      "text": "um because capitalism is based i just want to start off by saying that i spent a lot of time on amazon because i was going to respond to econoboy's horrible appropriation of violent communist flags and other stuff in the background i was going to buy a bunch of nazi and they don't actually sell nazi flags on amazon so i don't appreciate that i feel like it's very uh one-sided and and how they run things over there um the when it comes to like a larger discussion on this um i don't know if i need to clarify this or not but i guess just for anybody listening who doesn't catch everything on every platform obviously there were a lot of heated debates between me and pisco and econoboy and other members of different communities having to do with like leftists and tankies and bad actors and everything uh just to clarify for the 50 millionth time i don't think econoboy is a secret tanky i don't think he's secretly trying to be subversive or doing things i do disagree i think fundamentally with a lot of his platform but not in the same way that i would say that like um other like marxist latinists are bad faith actors trying to worm the weight of the system to destroy everything in a way that they're not upfront about i guess for anybody that needs to hear that or isn't uh clear of that um so i guess our conversation will probably revolve around a few things in this uh debate or conversation whatever we call this so i think the first issue i have is i think there's like an unclear vision of what socialism actually is or means uh i think it's kind of ironic or not ironic but funny i guess that econoboy kind of started off clarifying you know what his version of socialism is that he doesn't think that nordic countries are socialist and i just it seems like that on one hand you want to say not not econoboy in general but on one hand like people want to say that they're socialists but then you fight so much against like what socialism means or what it doesn't mean that the label starts to become meaningless and i think that the issue is that it allows for a lot of bad faith actors to come in and kind of usurp that label and use it as kind of a disguise or a mask for more insidious views so i think it's one reason i don't like the socialist label if what somebody's advocating for is largely liberal or works in a liberal or capitalist framework um i think there are huge moral and democratic questions about what the expropriation of property ultimately looks like a lot of the examples i think that econoboy gives for how we could expropriate property i think are a little bit uh unsatisfactory so when we bring up things like civil assets for civil asset forfeiture or things like a eminent domain like we're not taking these things to socialize them or to make them like a part of a socialist economy usually they're done for other reasons sometimes for punishments for crimes or sometimes for you know necessary government projects i don't think that those comparisons are the same as trying to acquire 90 to 100 percent of the overall capital of the united states uh you know under the ownership of the government i think that um when we talk about egalitarianism and when we talk about idealized forms of economies uh i don't know how much time i'll argue this but i think it's interesting that you always hear this argument even capitalists give here arguments will uh uh socialists will say and capitalists will say well you know socialism only works in an idealized form of society where there's no human greed and in an ideal world maybe we'd be socialist but i don't actually know why that's true i feel like people assume that and it's not necessarily the case like i can envision an ideal socialist world where everybody shares in the means of production and we all get the fruits of our own labor and you know we all can do that sure but i could also conceive of an ideal capitalist world where everybody has really high paying jobs they can choose who they want to work for at any point in time and quit and leave and like i feel like you could have idealized versions of both worlds it's just difficult because with capitalism there's a real world implementation of that and you have to fight on that real world implementation and then on the socialist version you have to fight on the kind of like idealized or utopian version so it's harder to kind of like point out flaws um four and five i think uh for the fourth point i've got socializing profits is a thing that socialists always talk about like we want equal ownership in the means of production so that we can all kind of reap the rewards and i think that's an attractive quality about sharing the ownership of the means production but it also means socializing decisions and i feel like there's not as much time paid to the socializing decisions parts so for instance if the government owns 90 to 100 percent of all the capital in the country that means that every new business started kind of has to be started by the government so are we taking votes on that are they going to be picking winners and losers are they going to decide you know whether or not there's an 18 or older id verification limit on my gravity consumption or whether or not league of legends gets canceled for dota 2 or whatever else um and then i think that for the final thing um this is kind of a general complaint i've had when people talk about like oh you know we got these really good things because of socialism in the united states whether you're talking minimum wage or 40-hour work weeks or whatever else i think it's important to clarify that all of these things are happening in a liberal system and there are good things that can happen from lots of different modes of economic production and lots of different countries that can happen in a liberal capitalist system but if we were to move to a fully socialist system we could only do the good socialist things you wouldn't have any of the good capitalist things and i think that is problematic"

      "text": "yeah okay so who would decide how to make them yeah well i mean the well in terms of who would decide how to make them i mean that like i said i mean i think that would be a rules-based process you'd probably have some kind of super structure for you know some basic rules that you would establish for managing the whole portfolio of holding corporations where they would decide you know okay like what are the basic guidances we want to give to these holding corporations um what are the kind of like transparency requirements that we would have and then similar to your point like okay well this is how we would uh determine when to spin off new holding corporations with the accumulations from either tax revenue other public assets or the sovereign wealth fund right so okay okay the only the only reason i'm focusing on this this part so hard is because in my opinion one of the best advantages of capitalism if you want to be a capitalist cuck which i am um is that capital can respond efficiently and quickly and robustly to huge economic problems i think when people argue there was some paper i think it was on uh working favorite iber or whatever that said like no liberal economy in the history of the planet has had a massive famine or whatever and part and i think part of the argument was that not only is the media able to report on things quickly but capital can shift very quickly around to different sections of the economy to respond and adapt to different things so this is so one of the advantages of capital is that people can identify market signals put money in an area and invest in something and then you know do do whatever they want there but when we talk about these holding corporations we're talking about removing that decision-making apparatus and and and somehow making it a government thing and i'm trying to figure out like how are these things made and if to gloss over this and then to move on to the rest of stuff this is like the hard stuff that i would argue that if capital does anything well it's this is allocating capital yeah well right so there's a number of ways where i think that that concern is kind of misplaced so number one if we look at how capital is actually invested in current society and there's a lot of papers on this is um most kind of liquid capital that's invested is passively invested right it's like people that aren't even making any sort of an active decision with how they're investing their capital right so in some sense you could say by transitioning a great bulk of that market you know if we just were to like neutrally buy assets so for every one asset that we buy that's actively managed another one's passively managed um and economists have said that this passive investment is kind of a problem for the allocated process we're kind of transitioning to a more actively managed market in the first place i don't know if i agree with that that most capital that is allocated today is allocated passively the lick the lick like the liquid capital right so these are most of the assets that are managed by these institutional investors like the overwhelming portfolio what do we mean when we say passively managed so when you pass well i mean you know what passive management is right so like passive management is when you would just invest money that essentially just tracks an index on behalf of you know it's essentially managed by the asset holding corporation right it's not really something that you're going out and sort of trying to find you know the the uh the the the actual good investments out there you're just kind of free riding off of all the other allocations that are happening actively sure so i feel like it's we can call it passive management but isn't that kind of like one layer removed because the funds that you're tracking are index funds that are that are kind of being managed by people that are you know trying to pick like a good assortment of funds within a particular index and then the index itself can change based on market capitalization companies and it like it is like passively managed in the same way that like if i give money to an ice cream maker i'm like passively giving that money and i'm not actually making my ice cream but a guy that's getting the money is actively making the ice cream right well well there's a lot of papers on how this is like an allocated distortion right because when you essentially it makes it to where there's not as much actual entrepreneurial investing activity and you're in theory you're increasing the risk of improper allocation of capital because you're sort of necessarily lowering the amount of actual active investing that people are doing when they're going out and trying to search for the best investments and so the holding corporations by engaging in an active management process are kind of um you know effectively solving that problem on by some great proportion and ideally leading to better allocative efficiency because again i i do advocate for very strict technocratic management of these assets um it you know in general um just the last thing just one more thing the last thing that i haven't been able to say is that um you you keep on saying that um the decision making process of like you know capital moving in certain places when they see market activity again like that that whole competitive process between these asset managers is still internalized into my system that these big asset managers that are now publicly owned would have the same competitive dynamics and incentives to do the exact same thing under my system as they do under our current system they'd have the profit motive market dynamics"
