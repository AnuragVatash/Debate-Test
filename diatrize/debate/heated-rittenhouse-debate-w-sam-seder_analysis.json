      "text": "So I emailed you relating to Rittenhouse stuff. Before we dive like too deep into things, I guess something that I've been kind of noticing that's like broadly occurring across the United States is I've noticed that there is like a, there's a really big fixation on changing processes and focusing on processes as being broken to kind of effect change legislatively or whatever. And it seems like people have kind of given up on ever having like a cohesive United States where we can kind of agree on some things again. So like, for instance, people will talk about like getting rid of the filibuster, completely changing how we gerrymander, rebalancing the Senate, making Puerto Rico a state, getting rid of the electoral college. Like these are like the, we're all the focuses. And we've kind of just like given up on like, there's no way that we're ever gonna agree on on certain things anymore. So I guess when I have conversations with people, especially people that I disagree with, conservatives, I usually try to start from a point of like common understanding, like, okay, what are some things that we do agree on that are real? And then from there, we kind of like move to other conversations, I guess. Does that make sense?"

But I mean, it's not, I mean, the filibuster has been changed before, I think probably three or four times, at least more. It was changed a year ago to raise the debt ceiling. I mean, so I don't think that's as dramatic of a process change. And people have been talking about getting rid of the electoral college for at least 25 years. I mean, I remember talking about it in college, that would have been 30, 35 years ago."

If you look at how many people are represented by the Republicans in the Senate versus the Democrats, you're gonna see tens of millions of unbalance there. That in a 50-50 Senate, you have literally tens, 40 million, I think more Americans represented by the 50 Democrats than the 50 Republicans. You've seen two out of the last three presidential elections that elected a Republican with a, with not, never mind, without, not only, not without a majority, without a plurality of the votes. You're seeing, you know, gerrymandering that leads to a disbalance in votes in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. I mean, those actually have been fixed because of the state Supreme Courts, but in the past where more than 50% of people vote for a Democratic candidate and the Republicans have 65% of the representation there. And when you look at the Supreme Court, I mean, people have been wanting to reform that for a long time as well, but it's, I think, particularly problematic where you have those two presidents who didn't win a majority of the votes have placed the six Republican or Supreme Court nominees on there, so."

Not just differences in beliefs in terms of what's right or wrong, but differences in beliefs in terms of like the reality of what's actually happening in situations.

But, at that time, what Castro would do is he would bring police in from the rural areas to police in Havana, because of that rural-urban divide. And, I mean, so, and I can assure you the technology, the communications technology there was not, you know, it was, well, first of all, it was 20 years ago, so we didn't have, but there was no internet per se there in the way that we understand it. And so, I mean, I think, but there's no doubt, technology has exacerbated it, you know, it heightened the gerrymandering, I think, too, to make it so efficient. But I would agree with all that.

      "text": "Okay, so, with the broader, the macro picture out of the way, looking at the microscopic stuff, so, there are a lot of things that get brought up by mainstream and alternative media, where I feel like the messaging, I think, is, the messaging can be okay, but it's poisoned because all of the facts beneath it are wrong. And when those facts are wrong, I think you lose the ability to communicate any of your broader messaging to, like, a wider audience. I think a really good example of this is, I think Joe Rogan was highly irresponsible for having so much, like, Bunk Medicine introduced to huge audiences on his show, like Ivermectin. But when CNN starts saying things like, Ivermectin is just a drug for horses, it's only horse paste. Well, I mean, like, one Google search away, we can see that's not true. And then all of a sudden, Joe Rogan is spreading bad information about medicine. That message, which is true, becomes undermined, I think, because people are getting some of the facts wrong. And then, now coming more specifically, I feel like with the Rittenhouse stuff, I feel like Rittenhouse is pretty cut and dry a lot of different ways, but I still hear people get a lot of the, kind of, like, facts or analysis, in my opinion, like, really wrong. So, I think the thing I want to talk to you about is there's, like, three main points that I, we'll see if I can move you on any of them. Number one is I think that the riots in Kenosha were literally propagated by fake news. They should have never happened. I think that Rittenhouse had just as much reason to be in Kenosha as any other person that was there. I think that all of the Rittenhouse killings were the two, and then the one shooting the guy's bicep were all in self-defense and had nothing to do with defending property. These are three points that I see repeated the opposite way by left-leaning mainstream and alternative media over and over and over again. I think that all three are, like, clearly wrong."

I mean, I, you know, I don't want to litigate whether people should have been upset and, you know, should be upset about policing in this country relative to black people in particular. I mean, that to me is, and you can argue that the Kenosha, you know, protests were set off by, you know, Blake's killing. Well, Blake's shooting, right? Shooting, sorry. And I guess he's paralyzed. And you could argue that it was just that without any of the context of the protests that had been going on across the country and the building, you know, literally decades. I mean, I would tell this story for years on my show. When I was in straight entertainment, I did a sitcom called The Show. And it was a white head writer on an all-black variety show. And one of the guys I worked with was a guy named Chris Spencer. And Chris, we went back to his house at a break during a shooting or rehearsal or whatever it was. And we pull into his garage in West Hollywood. And we get followed as we come in by his buddy in a Range Rover. And at that time, that was like the, if you were successful in L.A., you had a Range Rover. And this was, again, this was in the mid-90s. And the guy comes in, he's like, thank God you were there. I got, I was being followed by the cops again for the fourth time this week because they pulled me over three times to check and see if this was my car. And he said he had called the police department and spoke to a sergeant. It was like, is there a sticker I can get that says this is my car? And the cop said, are you black? And he said, yes. And he said, there's really nothing I can do for you. And so, I mean, this has been going on, well, far before that. But certainly, you know, at least in terms of our lifetime, has been going on and on. So I think you can say people should not have been upset by the shooting of Blake. And that was the only reason why they protested and they protested on false grounds. But I mean, I don't even think that's worth litigating. People can make their own determination as to whether those protests were justified. As far as the second one that you said was-"

      "text": "Yeah. So on the first one, so when I'm thinking of like how I want to deal with a particular thing, I usually try to think of like, well, what happens on the other side? I want to be able to, have you ever heard of the term stochastic terrorism? It's like this idea that like, if you give enough of a certain type of rhetoric, even if you don't directly call people to violence, there's probably going to be some violence that happens. So I would say like Tucker Carlson, when he talks about the great replacement over and over and over and over again, and then when some kid picks up a gun and he starts killing black people or like immigrants or whatever, it's pretty obvious that like, even if I can't draw a straight line from A to B, I can see how somebody could get from A to B. So I want to be able to condemn people on the right when they give irresponsible rhetoric that leads to things like shootings or things like the January 6th attempted coup insurrection. I want to be able to say, when you engage in this type of rhetoric or language, it's dangerous and it will cause people to do this. So I think for Kenosha, I wouldn't say that like an amalgamation of things led to those riots. I would say pretty clearly, it was absolutely the coverage of the Jacob Blake shooting. Jacob Blake was shot on August 23rd. There were riots that day and on the 24th and on the 25th was the Rittenhouse shooting. That timeline of like three days is not an accident. It was very clearly the video went out of Jacob Blake being shot. Every left-leaning media person in the world jumped on it, started blasting it all over Twitter, all over social media, all over mainstream media as like a poor innocent black guy that got shot in the back by cops six times. A lot of people still think he was killed even. I think that the misreporting and the mishandling of that was absolutely the biggest drive of those Kenosha riots that happened in the following days."

And you can say that the coverage was poor and that in my mind has really, is in no way a mitigating factor in my mind for the actions that Rittenhouse took. So it's sort of irrelevant relative to my perception of Rittenhouse. I mean, there's, I take it as a granted that at any given time, news is sensationalistic. And the way that our media is organized now, it's sensationalistic, you know, depending on who they perceive their audience to be and et cetera, et cetera. I mean, there were protests, peaceful protests in that first day. At night, things turned ugly and, you know, maybe it is the media's fault or certain media outlets and not others. I mean, but I think like the impetus to protest, it's pretty hard to say that when you're talking about, you know, a, you know, a proceeding, whatever, 12, 18 months you want to say, where you've had some of the biggest protests about police shootings that the country has seen to say that that's completely divorced from that context. I mean, I think there's a very hard argument to make, but like I say, relative to Rittenhouse, none of that is relevant to me."

Like I'm not going to argue against police, like even the facts of the matter relating to police bias. There was a huge, like over a hundred million traffic stops. The Veil of Darkness study that I think was published in Nature, Human Behavior, or whatever. I mean, so what you were talking about with your friend being pulled over in the Range Rover, like, yeah. I mean, these are pretty inarguable. So I wouldn't disagree with that. But the Kenosha stuff being spurred on by what I would consider to be essentially fake news was, I thought, a little bit troubling. But so for point two, I hear this a lot. It's repeated a lot. I've heard it on your show quite a few times. This idea that like Rittenhouse drove over state lines or he drove to a neighboring city. Like his dad lived in that city. He worked there as a lifeguard. It was like a 20 minute drive. I don't think that that, I think he had just as much right to be in that community as literally any other protester there."

And I go down there and I sit in the bodega and maybe with a weapon, maybe not, and to protect that. And I think, look, we can't know what is in Kyle Rittenhouse's, you know, mind or heart in that moment. Maybe he felt such a close connection to that community that he, you know, that's what spurred him on to grab a gun and go down there and patrol or not. I mean, I don't know. You don't know. We can't know that. It is material insofar as, you know, crossing state lines makes it seem like it's further away. I don't know if I ever said crossing state lines. I mean, my understanding of why we're here is you saw a video of mine on Twitter and or through Twitter and you reached out to me that's conceivable. But, you know, I had very little coverage of the Rittenhouse case itself. In fact, none of the actual case. I think I did a video following the verdict, but it has been not so much, I guess a policy you could say, but just like I don't watch legal cases. I just find that not to be helpful. I didn't watch the O.J. Simpson trial. I wasn't in this business. I didn't watch the Johnny Depp and his girlfriend trial. I just don't watch trials. And I didn't watch the Zimmerman trial. I don't follow them. I don't cover them in general because I think, you know, that's where you have to try. It's a spectacle, I think."

On the last part, the reason why people were down there was because on the 24th, the Kenosha Guard formed on Facebook in response to car dealership, over 100 cars, and neighboring buildings being set on fire on a block, right? So that's why that like little militia thing formed on Facebook. Now, whether you heard about it from Facebook or a friend that heard about it on Facebook, there was a reason why that had formed. It wasn't just randomly like, I'm going to go down to a place. Number one, for the second thing, I think that when I look at people's characterizations of events, I think we can be like a little bit more sophisticated than are the facts 100% like correct or incorrect. I think it goes a little bit deeper than that. Like, I'm sure you've heard people say like 1350 over and over again, right?"

Like the characterization is kind of strange that he's like driving to a neighboring town. Like it's pretty common that people's communities, especially in rural areas, are in other areas. He's from a different town in a different state. He went down to protect either because he saw it on Facebook or because his friend said to protect a car dealership. That's what I said and then he killed people, which he did. True. Then also, the second thing is the idea that he's killing people to defend property, that isn't true either. He didn't kill anybody in defense of property."
