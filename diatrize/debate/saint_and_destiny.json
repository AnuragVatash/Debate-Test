So we'll play a couple of clips of yours and then we'll discuss it and react to it. And then if you want to get into any other political items, we can do that. But you'll notice that the title of this stream is twofold. Number one, it states that you're racist. And the funny thing is I almost never use this term. I think it's overused and mostly people are lying and they're using that as an excuse to explain why they personally are losers. But in your case, you exposed yourself. So we'll review that piece. And then there's a second thing you did, which is an abusive language. And I find it to be very disgusting and dangerous. And you use this term homophobia, which actually doesn't really exist in real life. It's something that the left often does. You guys like to create words. And then you like to instrumentalize words and also pseudoscience to achieve your ends. And so we're going to discuss this concept of homophobia. And then, you know, if you want to add on anything on the back end, oh, fantastic. How's that sound?"

Like he was, I watched him talk to other people where he seemed smart. He was in business, seemed smart.

I think it's certainly appropriate that you be someone who is an example. And this is why we don't like to see hypocrisy in religious leaders because we expect them at some level to, to walk a straight path. So the answer is that you are not ever going to be perfect, but you should be a better example.

Because, why not? I think that I... The idea behind this is you can basically buy and sell. Or you can buy and sell like Twitch clips. And then you get an NFT that you can autograph. Okay. By the streamer. The clips of. Oh my God. Did you know that? And 10% of the revenue goes to the streamer. 10% of the revenue goes to the streamer. They are their NFT.

So what did you do? You started scamming. And who'd you start scamming? Your own fan base. So clip one, you're saying NFTs are a scam. Clip two, you're selling NFTs. Based on your experience, being a person who says don't do it, but then you do it because you can make money. You're someone who has no integrity.

How do you let me know? One guy. In your own words, can you explain what an NFT is? I never cared to learn. It's kind of complicated, but I think essentially what an NFT is, is there's some, every amount, every kind of data that you see on your screen is ultimately reducible to zeros and ones or some sort of, there's some sort of way that you can take all of the data and compress it using an algorithm to like move digits and pixels in different areas. And it's called a hash, essentially. It's like the quick and dirty version of it. And an NFT is essentially like a demarcation, I think, on some kind of blockchain. I think it was usually on, oh, what was the one? Ethereum, I think, is where a lot of NFTs were. So an NFT is like a, is like a part of a blockchain where there is a hash there and the owner of that hash is a person that is like, has to be like a unique thing because everybody in that blockchain agrees essentially on what it is. That's essentially what an NFT is. It's basically like a digital unique item and the uniqueness is verified by whatever blockchain it's based off of. It doesn't have to be Ethereum. I think you can have NFTs from other blockchains but they're generally from Ethereum."
