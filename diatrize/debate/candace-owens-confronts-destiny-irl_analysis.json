But, so essentially, at the end of last year, Diddy was dating that girl Cassie for a long time, about 10 years. Okay. And she started making allegations that Diddy was very, you know, very into, into some very sexually deviant things, is what I would say. And forced her to do a lot of things against her will, or drugs, whatever. She files this lawsuit, and basically overnight, I'm obviously being a bit hyperbolic, but he pays her off. So it ends. And then Cat Williams kind of, like, makes, alludes to the fact that more stuff is going to come out in 2024, and then a producer, whose name is Rodney, drops a lawsuit, and he alleges to have, you know, hundreds of hours of footage backing up his claims. And in the lawsuit, he actually dropped pictures. So it wasn't just this. Because you can always have a frivolous lawsuit. It can mean nothing. And what essentially his lawsuit suggests, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, just for protection here, is that there's a blackmail ring in Hollywood. Diddy is a gangster. On top of Diddy sits Lucian Grange, who is the CEO of Universal Music Group, that, and this was, for me, one of the wildest parts. He tells a story about one night where Diddy got mad at somebody and just shot them in, like, the stomach and the hip. He shows the pictures of the blood all around the bathroom, because he was right there when the person got shot, and he allegedly went to his knees and tried to help the person. It was Diddy and his son who allegedly shot him. But they said that there's one person that you call when something like that happens, and that guy's name is, like, Fahim something, and he will come clean it up. The LAPD will write a fake police report, and he shows, like, how the news then reported that the shooting happened outside, and then it got wiped under the rug. And what's interesting is that guy who you call, the security guy, was the same security person who was one of only two people there when Michael Jackson died. So it's now reopened, all the Michael Jackson stuff. Super interesting. A lot of stuff that I would say, a lot of proof presented in these documents, like I said, there's a lot of photos included. And if what he is spelling out is correct, then it's basically a homosexual ring that works by black males. They host these, what he calls, freak-offs, and they drug people, and they get them to sleep with a minor or do something, you know, that you wouldn't want publicized, and then they own you, right? Because it's like, well, we have you on camera doing this, and so you're going to say or do whatever I want. So very much like the Jeffrey Epstein stuff."

And it's just a change that I've noted in a lot of my commentary, and, you know, I think other people have, like, I asked the question, there's a really, in my view, disgusting artist, just in terms of the stuff that she publishes and the photos that she publishes, named Sexy Red, who they're now making a thing, right? Who makes the decision to sign a Sexy Red? You're telling me you have all the money and all the talent at your fingertips, and you sign a woman who, at her baby shower, nine months pregnant, however pregnant she was, was twerking, and had her butt cheeks in, like, somebody's face was inside of her butt cheeks. That, to me, is very intentional. Because you're not signing her based on talent. You're not signing her based on following. You're signing her because it's filth. And you're perpetuating this filth into my community. So, I, yeah, I've just, it's just something that I've noticed, something that I talk about often, that are, we're intentionally being sold crack, it feels like, you know."

Um, I feel like when you look at the evolution of, when we say, like, degenerate black culture or degenerate black music, I think we're generally talking about, like, the beginning of hip-hop and rap, and then kind of the evolution of that going forward, coming away from, like, the R&B singers and everybody, like, in the 50s, 60s, 70s, whatever, right? Yeah. Um. But hip-hop isn't always filth. But, yeah, I get your point. Yeah, but that seems like the general, yeah. Um, it feels like when I, when I look at music or if I look at music that, um, people create, oftentimes the music is a reflection of their circumstances. And you can see, uh, especially as America and the black communities became more conscientious, maybe, of the ghettos that they'd been kind of pushed into or the policing situations that they'd had to be a part of or drugs destroying their communities, et cetera, et cetera. Um, and then those people turning to crime, that you also see the music and the art kind of reflect those conditions and then those pieces of art that get, that get created, especially the music, end up being, like, worldwide popular. Like, the most popular genre of music in the, in the world is, like, hip-hop and rap. So, when I, when I look at people pushing certain stuff today, I'm like, okay, well, um, we got two really big, in my opinion, uh, I went to school for music. I don't know if you thought about the saxophone or whatever. So, we had two really big contributions to the world of music from America. One was jazz, um, that came basically from the black community. And then the second was, like, rap and hip-hop. Um, these forms of music become popular. People see that it's popular. They want to get involved. Obviously, the money men, the people on top, they want to kind of continue to push this because it's popular and everybody around the world consumes it. I feel like there are a lot of market forces at work that kind of perpetuate this and keep this happening. And that feels pretty satisfying to me to explain what's going on. So, when we ask, like, why is it a woman, uh, twerking with somebody's face and her butt shakes? Because, well, for whatever reason, that's, like, what the worldwide culture seems to want to see right now."

I come from nothing. It's not that, that did not make me feel closer to the circumstances that I grew up in. And unfortunately, that's actually what people are telling black Americans. Like, actually, it's working the other way. You're putting something, you know, your eyes and your ears are the windows to the soul. And you're basically, when you celebrate someone, and I'm using Cardi B here as an example because I think people are probably more familiar with her than they are with Sexy Red. When you put someone like that on the Grammy stage, which is, again, a decision being made. When I was growing up, the best, most talented people were on the Grammy stage. It was something you could watch with your family. And we still had poor people. You still had, yeah, you still had poor people. You still had people that were living in the hood. Okay, we didn't need somebody talking about their vagina in order to feel seen. So what you're doing is you're setting the stage for younger girls who aspire to celebrities to say, okay, well, if I mimic that behavior, I too can become famous.

You might be being entertained, but they are making decisions about what will entertain you, and a great circumstance in which he presented that is evidence of that is transgenderism, and he asked a question, hold on, hold on. He asked a question, which should be answered. He said to Joe Rogan, and he laughed about it. He was like, a guy wears a dress on the red carpet, okay, and then the media tells you how great he wore the dress, and he's like, if, he said, tell me one situation where he didn't wear the dress wonderfully, when he didn't wear the dress in a way that was amazing. It's because they have all agreed that this is the narrative, and then he talked about the fact that the record execs also own the publications that are saying that something is amazing or something is not amazing, and that is just plain old-fashioned propaganda, so you don't necessarily need to detach what we're talking about from your concept of what governments are interested in.

There's not like it's not like a DA case not like federal prosecute you think that the Diddy stuff is like rock solid. You think that's really really really important to look at. But then when we look at indictments that have gone to grand juries that have then issued warrants or subpoenas or whatever I was just curious if you think that the credibility on that side is as heavy as the P. Diddy stuff."

In the case of Diddy you have somebody that has no power that is filing this and producing evidence to say that the justice essentially the same thing that people that defend Trump are saying the justice system is corrupt right that these people are responding and being motivated by things like the LAPD's involvement that night in writing a fake police report if his allegations are true and he had photos and said that he was the person that said call 9-1-1 and then seeing the media report on it and lie about what happened at that studio is very scary. It's scary if unless he faked these blood photos which is a plausibility but it shows you that there are people that are sitting at the top that have a ton of power right. So the people that are acknowledging that and then also saying that those same people that that same network of individuals that can make up allegations and make them go away with the media or stay or and make it a big deal because of the media are defending Trump and what's happening to him. So this isn't they're actually these two things are not a conflict with one another what's happening with Diddy and what's happening with Trump. It's actually they compliment one another in terms of what we're saying. Now the only case I've followed two of them the Fannie Willis one."
